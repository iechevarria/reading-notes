the following are my personal notes on the new lombard street. this is not a
summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## introduction
- 3 - operations of money market make modern credit system work, cash flows meet
    cash commitments; failure to pay one can cascade and cause further failure
- 4 - econ: look at present as result of past through veil of money; finance:
    look at present valuations as imagined future cash flows
- 5 - finance/econ obscure original bank task: balance elasticity and
    discipline in interbank lending; both treat liquidity as free good
- 6 - finance/econ say interest is about time, not price of liquidity
- 7 - wicksell: bank rate should match "natural rate" of interest; credit has
    inherent stability that bankers mismanage
- 8 - money view: instability natural for credit markets; bagehot's "money does
    not manage itself"; central bank that only tries to eliminate liquidity
    constraints exacerbates instability b/c participants lose discipline
- 9 - taylor/wicksellian policy too biased toward ease; ease was impossible
    in bagehot's time b/c gold standard
- 9 - return to gold standard doesn't fit today's needs, too much discipline

## one: lombard street, old and new
- 13 - distinction between speculative and productive credit hard to draw
- 14 - central bank general power comes from ability to control price and
    availability of funds in times of necessity
- 14 - historically, art of central banking was controlling short-term interest
    rate - cost of putting off payment that is due today
- 16 - if you don't catch a bubble early, it can be impossible to do anything
    using interest rate policy
- 16 - larger a bubble grows, larger the distortion in allocation of credit and
    real resources commanded by that credit - increase everyone's interest rate
- 17 - on the way up, central bank lacks traction b/c everyone avoids central
    bank discipline; on the way down, they become lender of last resort; used
    wisely, prevents downturn from becoming rout; used unwisely, continues
    bubble
- 22 - bagehot's high rate of interest limited funds to those in most need but
    also protected gold reserve from excessive drain
- 25 - fed doesn't lend/borrow on federal funds market, so rate fluctuates based
    on supply and demand; fed uses treasury repo market to control supply of
    underlying deposits that are borrowed/lent on federal funds market
- 26 - private dealers borrow on money market to finance market-making in
    capital markets, so funding liquidity becomes market liquidity
- 27 - fed today is always lending freely, but only to primary dealers, against
    treasury collateral, at repo rate

## things to look up
- 12 - ralph hawtrey on inherent instability of credit
