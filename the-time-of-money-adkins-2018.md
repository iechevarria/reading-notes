the following are my notes on the time of money. this is not a summary. instead,
these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye.

## chapter 1: money on the move
- 26 - workers in a state of constant expectation; people say that the future
    has closed down bc capital needs workers in never-ending present
- 30 - esposito: people sell their futures for their present; this
    de-futurization shouldn't be allowed
- 35 - bourdieu: economic agents not rational calculators, instead driven by
    habitus, unconscious structures
- 35 - bourdieu: anticipation is natural part of action, so to say society is
    unnaturally forward-looking seems weird
- 40 - bourdieu: events/practices take place in time but also make time ... lol.
    calhoun + beasley-murray say this throws his account of time "into radical
    doubt" bc just look at clock dummy


## general comments
- 33 - this guy bourdieu seems like he's full of crap. he insists that "the
    future is always inscribed in the immediate present" bc agents anticipate
    future. what about chaos? to say nothing of randomness
- 34 - economic field creates predictable / calculable future - ???
- 35 - bourdieu: future inscribed in present, so can you really sell/ruin your
    future? yeah duh of course doofus. look at a chess game. some moves will
    allow you to make more moves down the line, others will restrict number of
    future options. definitely possible ya doofus!
- 40 - really don't need a framework as radical as bourdieu's to argue that
    actions are inherently participatory. take word2vec - trains on prediciton
    task. i can feel anticipation in conversation, i feel myself predicting the
    next word someone will say. take indigenous people's controlled burns -
    clearly a forward-looking action. don't need his weird dumb crap to see!!
