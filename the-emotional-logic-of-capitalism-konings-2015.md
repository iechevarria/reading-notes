the following are my notes on the emotional logic of capitalism. this is not a
summary. instead, these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye.

## introduction
- 1 - typical perspective: market has spun out of control, task of society is to
    limit consequences of unshackled markets (polanyian)
- 2 - polanyian thought accepts economistic account of economy, wants to use
    other parts of human life as independent factors
- 2 - economization is productive: organizes connections
- 3 - economy lets us grasp network of connections without having to retrace all
    details of its emergence
- 3 - money is relied on as objective fact even though it is just a social
    convention; is constructed so well that many parts work together
- 4 - only in critical mindset do we lose sight of constructive parts of economy
    and money, begin to see it as "merely constructed" and like idolotry
- 4 - disembedding critique looks past our daily experience with money
- 6 - groundless irrationality of idolater is fantasy of iconoclast, sign is not
    empty, and iconoclast is not above its influence b/c they try to break it
- 7 - idolatry critique is a way of externalizing problems and to legitimize our
    own investments in the sign by disavowing problems and saying they exist b/c
    the idolatry of others; do not demand less attachment to the sign but
    instead proper, nonidolatrous commitment
- 7 - modern subject doesn't transform own relationship to sign but instead
    makes fantasy of of corrupted other that did wrong and can't get the good
    from the sign
- 7 - "The modern subject tends to put iconoclastic sentiment at the service of
    its iconophilia"
- 8 - popular republicanism sees money / markets as source of corruption, looks
    to them as redemptive; say idolatrous subjects act wrong and stop money from
    being used as intended; these fantasies allow faith in purifying qualities
- 11 - neoliberalism: money mere convention, insist we do not fetishize it, need
    to make investments + honor debts -> combination of iconophilia and
    iconoclasm makes it easy to portray money as road to true republican self

## chapter 1: money as icon
- 15 - marxist + weberian: cash is corrosive, replaces human connection with
    cold calculation
- 16 - this is a "comforting plotline", "good story", not really helpful
- 16 - zelizer: money not uniform, used v differently based on social context
- 19 - polanyi: speculative credit boom -> claims w/ no basis in reality -> bust
- 19 - concern with money is not irrational, gives life
- 20 - we know in practicality what money is even if we have trouble formulating
    it conceptually
- 20 - money is iconic sign, embodies its meaning, communicates it significance
    but it is not clear how it does so, no correspondence between how it appears
    and what it does
- 20 - we immediately know what money means even if it's hard to delineate that
    meaning
- 21 - "In contemporary capitalism, money simply means social power; denying
    this is not so much a meaningful personal belief or a potentially effective
    attempt to resist the lure of a fetish, but rather the inability or
    reluctance to recognize a social fact."
- 24 - modern subject exaggerates past's irrationality
- 24 - traditional power required active endorsement of signs, required
    idolization; could not penetrate practical rationality, symbols remained
    external
- 25 - money has little inherent authority, depends on networks it's in; but
    influence becomes more deeply embedded in people; influence surpasses idol
- 25 - modern subjects develop organic affinities to icon

## chapter 2: affective signs
- 28 - "Capitalism, far from making authority anonymous and indifferent, makes
    things personal: it gets into our heads, becomes part of our identity,
    disposition, and desires, our basic sense of self."
- 33 - for affect to build, social life needs to be plastic - not so weak any
    outside influence will destroy its structure and not so strong it cannot
    change
- 35 - complexity of modern life means we don't know what's causing our problems
    so we often double down on existing routines / meanings that promise relief

## things to look up
- 16 - viviana zelzier on disembedding narrative
- 34 - rose 1999 on governance through risk
