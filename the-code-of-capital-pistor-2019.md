the following are my personal notes on the code of capital. this is not a
summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## 1: empire of law
- 8 - new york state and english common law dominate world of capital, also have
    largest financial centers
- 9 - global capitalists can pick and choose laws that are favorable to them
    without having to invest in politics to bend law
- 9 - empire of law severs connection between self-interest and society
- 9 - adam smith's invisible hand was predicated on need to stay at home to
    know local institutions, but today can receive legal protection anywhere
- 12 - northern investors lent against slave collateral, helping sustain slavery
- 12 - john commons: law enhances reliability of others' expected behavior
- 15 - money is backed by coercive power of state to impose liabilities on its
    citizens, this gives it value
- 16 - "When trade and commerce take place primarily within tightly knit
    communities, formal law enforcement may not be needed" -> sounds like a
    strong explanation for quaker and jewish presence in early banking
- 18 - more diverse assets + uneven distribution means more need for coercive
    law enforcement
- 19 - author's claim: legal coding accounts for value of assets, thus for
    wealth creation + distribution
- 20 - "States benefit from economics growth, because it boosts their tax
    revenue and allows them to raise debt finance" ???? what ???? not anymore
- 22 - asset holders do not need to capture the state directly, all they need
    are lawyers to code assets in law (contra marxists)

## 2: coding land
- 32 - lawyers in england 4x between 1578-1633 and they came from same social
    ranks as clients, so shared worldview
- 32 - land sales increased at the same time, prices 2.5x over 50 years by 1610
- 34 - at home, landowners relied on seniority, but in americas, they justified
    ownership with improvement to get land from first peoples
- 36 - fearing creditors, landowners enlisted lawyers who found the entail
    concept made land subject to strict family settlement
- 39 - land reform in england turned land into ordinary asset and 20% of land
    changed hands in 20 years after reforms
- 40 - same reforms enacted in americas in 1732 but in 1881 in england - shows
    it was a matter of political will; most creditors of american landowners
    were english so shift of balance of power was ok
- 40 - after independence, american law adopted some of the old features
- 42 - european colonies with settlers got legal systems like the ones at home,
    became richer afterward; colonies w/o settlers got systems for resource
    extraction, stayed poor
- 43 - "by insulating assets from various groups of creditors, the trust works
    magic in enhancing their durability"
- 44 - trust protects assets, so serves those with assets, the wealthy
- 45 - coase: transaction costs ubiquitous, so initial allocation of property
    rights matter a lot
- 46 - asset holders want protection for wealth to endure, so they need
    durability that's universally enforceable - not doable with private parties,
    so need a powerful state + laws

## 3: cloning legal persons


## things to look up
- 12 - john commons the legal foundations of capitalism
- 12 - jonathan levy on capital
- 17 - max weber on law and coercion
