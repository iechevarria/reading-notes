- 28 - "Now there was no way out. It was a comfort, in a way. Now he could stop worrying, stop thinking he had any choice."

# "a real joy to be had" kim stanley robinson interview by terry bisson
- 79 - "I thought I was getting tired of writing before, but now I realize I was only tired of spending so much time indoors sitting around. When it's outdoors it feels completely different."
- 79 - sierra club calendar w/ a week per page, few sentences at most per day "I now have twenty-three years of those filled out, and my wife and I have a game where I keep the ones from ten and twenty years before on the bed table under the new one, and I tell her what we were doing ten years ago and twenty years ago on that day. It is a way of placing us in time and our own lives"
- 80 - "we've become convinced that an evolutionary accident has left us in the curious state of having brains that can remember huge, huge amounts of incident; but we have no good recall mechanisms in us to go back and get them, so they sit there as knots or configurations of synapses, doing nothing but waiting. Very strange."
- 81 - "all my fiction has been published in SF magazines or books, although sometimes brought out as 'general fiction,' by my publisher, but booksellers know which section to put it in after it's off the front tables."
- 82 - "There is a real joy to be had in submitting to a task like a madman ... You get into a flow and then it's problem, solution, problem, solution, and that goes on at a smooth pace for a long time"
- 82 - "The part I like the least ... Well, first draft when faced with a hard idea can be tough. It makes you feel stupid. But I have learned to ignore that and grind on, and so it's not bad once you get in the habit."
- 82 - usually research just in time. if did research first, would never write. "And I find the research is so much more effective when it is specifically to support a particular scene or chapter."
- 83 - need things to be sort of similar to today. too far removed and you can't compare
- 87 - on infodumps - saying that you can only talk about people. "The proper study of mankind is man (Pope) etc., etc., well, that's just silly. Why be so narcissistic? There are many, many stories that are extremely interesting that don't happen to be about us. That's what science is saying, often, and that's what I'm saying in my science fiction."
- 89 - "I don't know what working in a commercial field does to a writer's vision. A lot of the effect must be unconscious. Ultimately you seem to be saying, does the desires for readers change what you write? Surely it must. But isn't the desire for readers pretty basic to writing? So, maybe it sharpens your vision, in those terms."
- 92 - "utopias are hard, and important, because we need to imagine what it might be like if we did things well enough to say to our kids, we did our best, this is about as good as it was when it was handed to us, take care of it and do better."
- 93 - "the writing of utopia comes down to figuring out ways of talking about just these issues in an interesting way; how tenuous it would be, how fragile, how much a tightrope walk and a work in progress."
