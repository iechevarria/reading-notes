- 4 - "Indeed one could with some justice claim that of all the elements of Japanese architecture, the toilet is the most aesthetic."
- 6 - I do not object to modern convenience "but I did wonder at the time why they could not be designed with a bit more consideration for our own habits and tastes."
- 6 - no toilets or stoves that "are at all tasteful" reached market
- 10 - tarnish on silver is the point, "dark, smoky patina." "Almost every householder has had to scold an insensitive maid who has polished away tarnish so patiently waited for."
- 11 - sheen of antiquity is "glow of grime" - of polish from being touched over and over again, skin oils on an object
- 12 - don't like dentist because of sound of drill but also "excessive glitter of glass and metal is equally intimidating"
- 13 - "Darkness is an indispensible element of the beauty of lacquerware."
- 19 - dark alcove for art is good. "all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly."
- 20 - "For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint, frail light can play"
- 23 - gold leaf and gold dust not extravagance but another way for light to work
- 23 - if gold in bright light, merely gaudy
- 23 - "As with lacquerware, the bold patterns remain for the most part hidden in darkness; only occasionally does a bit of gold or silver gleam forth."
- 36 - wanted to go to autumn-moon viewing but heard that a temple would have loudspeakers with recordings - "I canceled my plans immediately"
- 36 - lights are too hot (not really a problem anymore)
- 39 - "now that we cannot cross an intersection without consulting a traffic signal, old people can no longer venture confidently out into the streets."
- 39 - in osaka, "it sets every nerve in my body on edge to cross from one side of the street to the other."

# afterword

- 45 - "He has a perverse habit of shifting without warning from a tone of high seriousness to something near facetiousness; as when he recommends the toilet as a major source of poetic inspiration."
- 45 - "One of the oldest and mostly deeply ingrained of Japanese attitudes to literary style holds that too obvious a structure is contrivance, that too orderly an exposition falsifies the ruminations of the heart, that the truest representation of the searching mind is just to 'follow the brush.'"
- 48 - "But for Tanizaki a museum piece is no cause for rejoicing. An art must live as part of our daily lives or we had better give it up."
- 48 - "Mrs. Tanizaki tells a story of when her late husband decided, as he frequently did, to build a new house. The architect arrived and announced with pride 'I've read your *In Praise of Shadows*, Mr. Tanizaki, and know exactly what you want.' To which Tanizaki replied, 'But no, I could never *live* in a house like that.' There is perhaps as much resignation as humor in his answer."
