the following are my personal notes on money: the unauthorized biography. this
is not a summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out
to me.

## 1. what is money?
- 14 - "Coins and currency ... are useful tokens to record the underlying system
    of credit accounts and to implement the underlying process of clearing."
- 14 - currency is not money, money is system of credit accounts
- 16 - knights of malta on copper coins when gold / silver rang low wrote motto:
    "Not the metal, but trust"
- 17 - coins dominate study of history b/c they physically survived
- 18 - english tally sticks hard to counterfeit b/c unique wood grain
- 18 - took 50 years to get rid of tally sticks (1782 to 1834)
- 20 - tally sticks destroyed, with them, tons of financial history
- 25 - ireland worked without money for 6+ months in 1970 using personalized
    credit system b/c banker strike
- 26 - worked in ireland partially b/c personal trust in country
- 27 - money has 3 fundamental elements: 1) abstract unit of value 2) system of
    accounts 3) ability to transfer between people
- 29 - irish story shows state not necessary for money to function (chartalism)
- 29 - what matters: issuers are creditworthy + belief obligations can transfer

## 2. getting money's measure
- 33 - money not a thing, but social technology
- 40 - neat descriptions of ancient myths on language, usually from gods
- 42 - mesopotamia initally kept track of things with physical tokens, checked
    that quantities matched; eventually moved from 3d objects to 2d depictions
    on slate; then to symbol with number

## 3. the aegean invention of economic value
- 54 - economic value a property of social world
- 58 - medieval people used different units for different contexts, so they
    had many units for the same physical properties
- 62 - first known coins minted in lydia and ionia in 6th century bc

## 4. the monetary maquis
- 68 - private notes were 1/3 money in argentina
- 69 - ireland worked with people to help things along without money, helped
    prepare, saw it coming; argentina was the one that closed the banks, so
    private money was against the state
- 71 - 40% of russian trade with private money by 1997, many private tokens
- 72 - private money a threat: credito -> continental dollar -> political revolt


## questions / critiques
- 36 - realistic depiction of ancient greek society? seems dicey
- 52 - weird description of separate spheres of value
- 53 - difficult to parse description of economic value
- 58 - suspect description of how greece was uniquely ready for money - coinage
    didn't originate in greece, it came from like turkey i think (says so on
    page 62 actually lol)
- 60 - this account omits mesopotamia's silver and liquid debt tokens. seems off
- 63 - weaker than similar discussion in debt by graeber about how greek society
    reacted to money's introduction
- 64 - where is the state in all this? no citations either
- 73 - james madison so wrong it hurts: if people were good, government wouldn't
    need to exist -> wrong wrong wrong, if people were good, government wouldn't
    need to exist *for markets to work*
