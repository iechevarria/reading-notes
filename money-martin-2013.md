the following are my personal notes on money: the unauthorized biography. this
is not a summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out
to me.

## 1. what is money?
- 14 - "Coins and currency ... are useful tokens to record the underlying system
    of credit accounts and to implement the underlying process of clearing."
- 14 - currency is not money, money is system of credit accounts
- 16 - knights of malta on copper coins when gold / silver rang low wrote motto:
    "Not the metal, but trust"
- 17 - coins dominate study of history b/c they physically survived
- 18 - english tally sticks hard to counterfeit b/c unique wood grain
- 18 - took 50 years to get rid of tally sticks (1782 to 1834)
- 20 - tally sticks destroyed, with them, tons of financial history
- 25 - ireland worked without money for 6+ months in 1970 using personalized
    credit system b/c banker strike
- 26 - worked in ireland partially b/c personal trust in country
- 27 - money has 3 fundamental elements: 1) abstract unit of value 2) system of
    accounts 3) ability to transfer between people
- 29 - irish story shows state not necessary for money to function (chartalism)
- 29 - what matters: issuers are creditworthy + belief obligations can transfer

## 2. getting money's measure
- 33 - money not a thing, but social technology
- 40 - neat descriptions of ancient myths on language, usually from gods
- 42 - mesopotamia initally kept track of things with physical tokens, checked
    that quantities matched; eventually moved from 3d objects to 2d depictions
    on slate; then to symbol with number

## 3. the aegean invention of economic value
- 54 - economic value a property of social world
- 58 - medieval people used different units for different contexts, so they
    had many units for the same physical properties
- 62 - first known coins minted in lydia and ionia in 6th century bc

## 4. the monetary maquis
- 68 - private notes were 1/3 money in argentina
- 69 - ireland worked with people to help things along without money, helped
    prepare, saw it coming; argentina was the one that closed the banks, so
    private money was against the state
- 71 - 40% of russian trade with private money by 1997, many private tokens
- 72 - private money a threat: credito -> continental dollar -> political revolt
- 78 - guanzi: money a tool of govt to regulate people's activity; basically had
    quantity theory of money
- 79 - seigniorage = money printer go brrr
- 79 - guanzi: sovereign should retain sole control of money, otherwise it loses
    power

## 5. the birth of the money interest
- 84 - after ad 300, banks disappeared from rome: not enough political / social
    stability for them to work (cough cough)
- 88 - crying down: saying coin is now worth less than used to be; distinct from
    debasement which is using cheaper metals for same value coin
- 92 - oresme, trying to convince sovereign not to touch currency too much:
    money belongs to the rich because they use it

## 6. the natural history of the vampire squid
- 103 - most risk-averse banking is short-term trade financing (sounds like
    mesopotamia in debt)
- 106 - bill of exchange: money token that was accepted at merchant houses + was
    denominated in abstract unit made by bankers, Ã©cu de marc; needs to be
    exchanged into sovereign currencies

## 7. the graet monetary settlement
- 115 - bankers needed a lot of trust to operate private money network; bankers
    have no force to threaten with -> exclusive club

## 8. the economic consequences of mr. locke
- 130 - reward for olympic games was just crown of palm leaves, so idea that
    money has value just by convention came naturally
- 131 - locke: rights exist by nature, so theory of money had to be altered to
    be somehow natural also
- 134 - mandeville: individual greed -> aggregate prosperity
- 135 - "The new world being forged by this corporate and financial revolution
    clamoured to be explained and justified - and Mandevill's outrageous
    hypothesis appeared to do both at once"
- 136 - smith: vision of econ system that trended to equilibrium; gave
    justification for monetary society in econ + political terms

## 9. money through the looking-glasss
- 140 - respect for contract alone not enough for monetary society, but also
    absolutists wrt to contracts foment revolution (in context of versailles)
- 144 - locke said money just a measurement of previous metal -> "Locke's
    understanding of money led not to a new age of objectivity in economic
    affairs" -> actually just arbitrary prejudices -> "it covered their tracks
    with a veil of apparent scientific objectivity" (sounds like ideology)
- 145 - locke understanding of money paved way to market above all else ->
    paved way for moral disaster by policy makers
- 149 - excellent description of irish potato famine and economic reasoning for
    allowing it to happen; ecconomics claimed to reduce "moral and political
    justice to the mechanical application of objective scientific truths"

## 10. strategies of the skeptics
- 152 - midas myth about reducing everything to single dimension, money
- 155 - money is paradox: both relies on other people but also isolates us by
    reducing our relationships to financial

## 11. structural solutions
- 168 - law: sovereign issuer needs to be able to vary supply of money, so don't
    use gold standard
- 175 - law: make money users explicitly bear risks instead of having sovereign
    promise to pay; money was then a claim to the tax flows which are based on
    productivity which is uncertain -> money became equity, not debt
- 183 - state should keep an eye on structure of financial obligations, make
    sure it's fair -> need politics to determine that -> need law to enact

## 12. hamleet without the prince: how economics forgot money
- 186 - summers: econ had nothing useful to say about great recession
- 187 - summers: econ got very distracted
- 189 - many top banks were quaker firms; neat anecdote about bill brokers
- 194 - bank needed money, raised money by selling equity, but saw sell-off b/c
    company w/ similar name went bankrupt
- 198 - bagehot: trust at center of banking system
- 201 - bagehot: central bank is uniquely able to stabilize, effectively manages
    all the money
- 202 - central bank lends at last resort, prevents panic from self-fulfilling
- 203 - bagehot: last resort lend at high interest to prevent moral hazard

## 13. ...and why it is a problem
- 208 - money not a simple commodity b/c demand for it goes up in crisis
- 212 - keynes: supply creates its own demand (say's law) -> false b/c people
    save cash
- 221 - macroecons tools didn't include money, abstracted away from money

## 14. how to turn the locusts into bees
- 226 - solvent: assets > liabilities

## questions / critiques / comments
- 36 - realistic depiction of ancient greek society? seems dicey
- 52 - weird description of separate spheres of value
- 53 - difficult to parse description of economic value
- 58 - suspect description of how greece was uniquely ready for money - coinage
    didn't originate in greece, it came from like turkey i think (says so on
    page 62 actually lol)
- 60 - this account omits mesopotamia's silver and liquid debt tokens. seems off
- 63 - weaker than similar discussion in debt by graeber about how greek society
    reacted to money's introduction
- 64 - where is the state in all this? no citations either
- 73 - james madison so wrong it hurts: if people were good, government wouldn't
    need to exist -> wrong wrong wrong, if people were good, government wouldn't
    need to exist *for markets to work*. also govt helps with uncertainty -
    unless angels are omniscient, still useful
- 75 - does sovereign need credit?
- 81 - great to see mesopotamia representation
- 84 - "coinage forgotten as means of representing money" idk seems iffy - in
    debt, graeber describes debts denominated in long-lost currencies. does this
    just mean people didn't have coins?
- 90 - "why tax when you can print money?" -> this book shows that happened!
- 123 - verbose opening to chapter, again verbose on 127
- 137 - uncritical citation of reinhart and rogoff
- 141 - debt explores idea of relationships transforming into financial
    obligations better imo
- 180 - too abrupt end to a section, didn't finish telling the story - i get the
    weaving here, but i just want to know what happened
- 182 - "only democracy" can decide what's fair, can make decisions that last ->
    idk dude, i like democracy enough too, but this is pretty bold
