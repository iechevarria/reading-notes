the following are my personal notes on money and government. this is not a summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## introduction
- 4 - stagnation of real earnings was deep cause of gfc, caused debt build-up
- 6 - economic ideas matter more now b/c economists make economic policy
- 11 - central question is what it always has been in political economy: what does govt need to do to securet smooth function of private economy (this hasn't always been the central question! see axial age empires, middle ages india - lots of central control where markets exist to benefit the state)
- 12 - dasgupta: "economic theory evolves in response to questions provoked by a given set of circumstances in the economy", as they change, theory changes
- 13 - economist justifications for free market more precise than business class "ideas are thus capable of making self-interest seem more enlightened"

## 1. the mysteries of money: a short history
- 25 - keynes thought liquidity preference existed b/c radical uncertainty
- 26 - coinage represents physical obligations to the state
- 28 - can inflate money instead of collecting taxes
- 29 - victorian fiscal constitution mandated balanced budget to prevent currency being debased
- 34 - quantity theory of money about supply of money, credit theory of money about demand for loans
- 35 - money is typically endogenous, sometimes exogenous as windfall like precious metals from south america into europe
- 38 - adam smith recognized supply of money should increase in line with demand

## 2. the fight for the gold standard
- 41 - locke: quantity of silver not objective measure of value, just more stabler than number of cows
- 43 - 1717 to ww1, inflation was 0.53%, avg magnitude of annual price changes was 4.42%
- 44 - "Like all social scientific analysis that claims to reduce the political to the natural, it was largely a cover for vested interest"
- 44 - gold too scarce, prevented expansion of money supply; money not automatically proportioned to need, has to be kept proportional
- 47 - real bills doctrine assumes full employment
- 47 - bank rate controls quantity of domestic credit
- 48 - malthus said ricardo abstracted too far from reality
- 49 - "One may feel that insistence on the need for short-run pain (e.g. austerity) for the sake of long-term gain, when the short-run can last decades and the long-run may never happen, testifies to a refined intellectual sadism."
- 51 - continuous fall in prices 1873 to 1896, called the great depression
- 53 - gold standard designed to prevent government over-spending, on the whole did work
- 55 - commitment to convertability reduced exchange risk -> expansion of trade
- 56 - currency convertability not threatened by democracy b/c limited suffrage and weak unions; unemployment emigrated from europe to america
- 56 - international trade was relatively non-competitive
- 57 - gold standard was cheap and efficient credt-rating agency
- 57 - european loans went to colonies which provided sheltered markets
- 58 - london functioned as international central authority / bank
- 59 - 'pound as good as gold' -> not convertability, but fiscal restraint
- 59 - british farming destroyed by cheap american imports

## 3. the quantity theory of money: from history to science
- 61 - wicksell: money supply created by banks through loans, central bank has indirect control by changing price of loans
- 63 - fisher and cambridge qtm present transactional view of money
- 64 - fisher and cambridge assume stable velocity of money, no change in demand for money; assume stable ratio of reserves to deposits
- 65 - qtm only valid with constant velocity
- 68 - governemnts do not have direct control of money supply
- 70 - wicksell adopted qtm for mechanism to manage economy fluctuations

## 4. the theory of the fertile and barren state
- 75 - keynes: limited effective demand prevents full potential output
- 77 - increased wealth only became state policy in 17th-18th centuries (what??? this sounds unlikely! what about the mining operations in ancient greece)
- 82 - smith: mercantalist wars fought for state and vested interests, bad for the consumer
- 83 - smith: britain should not be empire "and endeavor to accomodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances"
- 86 - income tax gave secure revenue base, made voters want cheap government
- 87 - british social reform driven by desire to compete with us, germany
- 90 - us got into deregulation, free trade in 1940s when it displaced britain as top dog
- 91 - rothschilds said they didn't want to lend money for war, but states that get in wars are strapped for cash and need to borrow, so kinda did
- 93 - "The history of fiscal theory shows that, far from being the scientific paragon it claims to be, it is highly ideological"

## 5. keynes's intervention
- 101 - central bank needs to create expectation that price level will not move too much from price of standard composite commodity
- 104 - austrians said 1929 crash caused by excessive credit creation, keynes thought it was 1928 interest rate hike which collapsed healthy boom
- 104 - schumpeter said let recession run its course, "Economists whose common sense had not been completely destroyed by their theories rejected the drastic cure of destroying the existing economy in order to rebuild it in the correct proportions."
- 106 - "There is no secure way of settling this argument."
- 115 - keynes: deep recession might need negative interest
- 116 - keynes: expectations about economy control expectations about money; need to manage expectations about output + employment, need fiscal policy
- 117 - hopkins: success of policy depends on model of economy in minds of businesses
- 119 - keynes: borrower expectation of risk as important as investor'ss
- 119 - keynes: investment inverse to uncertainty -> increase demand for cash
- 120 - keynes: investors do not know their risk, so subject to sudden collapses when confidence gone
- 120 - "What we think of as objectivity is trapped within the circle of expectation"
- 120 - "In a monetary economy, they [conventions and animal spirits] never escape the circle of money to reach supposedly underlying 'fundamentals'."
- 121 - keynes: money is "a subtle device for linking the present to the future"
- 121 - financial institutions do not intermediate between savers and investors, they provide liquidity when needed at a price
- 124 - keynes wanted maximum output so we could get fully automated future
- 124 - keynes: keep long-term interest rate continuously low so that people don't wait for good rates
- 125 - keynes: low interest rates alone not enough to recover from slump
- 126 - keynes: during recession, create real resources like housing w/ state (absolutely fire excerpt here)
- 128 - keynes: replace gold w/ global reserve currency
- 130 - new deal: "public works programmes were not backed by any theory which showed why they were needed; the classical theory demonstrated they were unnecessary and harmful"
- 131 - keynes: keep banking under national control
- 131 - keynes saw problem as unused capacity, said little about distribution

## 6. the keynesian ascendancy
- 138 - econs had hard time accepting full employment was not the norm, thought general theory was really a special case
- 140 - keynesian policy kept west from communism
- 143 - us had a lot of automatic stabilizers (unemployment) between 1945-1961
- 144 - stabilizers don't expand demand, just make recessions lighter
- 146 - bank of england: change in money supply not rigidly linked to spending
- 147 - only policy for full employment, stable prices was control over costs
- 147 - gm, uaw linked wages to productivity, cost of living; german economy wages set by national emplyer-union bargains
- 148 - constraint on inflation was exchange rate
- 156 - europe + japan had high growth b/c they had supply shortages, not demand shortages b/c equipment destroyed in war; no keynesian solutions needed
- 157 - capital had high margainal productivity, so high productivity growth; allowed growth in real incomes while costs stayed stable
- 159 - us trade surplus negative by end of 50s b/c more competitive performance from europe + japan, commitment to stop communism
- 160 - us 'lived beyond its means' and allowed other countries to run surpluses
- 162 - "Anti-Keynesians who go on about inflation seem entirely oblivious to the gains in welfare achieved in this period. But to them the microbe of inflation has always been a greater evil than the scourge of unemployment"
- 162 - attempt to turn keynesianism into growth policy may have killed it
- 166 - 4x oil prices 73-74 has psychological impact, increasing inflation
- 166 - probably excess demand in us that led to breakdown of bretton woods
- 167 - keynesian policymakers didn't pay enough attention to supply side, productivity increased more slowly than wages
- 169 - balogh: collective bargaining not restrained by real resources
- 170 - 68-75 had many shocks at once that would have tested any policy regime, but led people to look for something else, so milton friedman got spotlight

## 7. the theory and practice of monetarism
- 174 - neoclassical synthesis based on two contradictory beliefs: optimizing agent + wage / price rigidities
- 174 - supply adjustments not important in great depression, relevant afterward
- 176 - hayek thought keynesianism was beginning of totalitarianism
- 177 - friedman said he was objective, author disagrees: "This is disingenuous. The motivation for his work was thoroughly political. Friedman restarted neo-classical economics in order to expel the expanded Keynesian state from the economy."
- 178 - friedman smoothed income over expected lifetime income
- 179 - friedman denied speculative demand for money, said people would keep cash balances at a minumum
- 179 - "Inevitably, the empircal examiniation was inconclusive; it always is"
- 183 - friedman assumed consumers would have adequate savings / access to credit in downturns (bad assumption); failed to see money as store of value
- 183 - "Friedman's weaknesses were overlooked because his theory served an ideological purpose."
- 184 - "Monetarism became fashionable because it was not the incumbent philosophy in a time of crisis"
- 187 - gradual disinflation didn't work, inflation reversed by shock therapy
- 189 - incredible chart showing oil price and uk cpi inflation w/ oil price leading inflation almost perfectly
- 190 - fact that inflation dropped worldwide in the 90s regardless of policy suggests structure of world economy made result
- 190 - attention needed to both supply and demand
- 192 - on laffer curve: "Their simplistic story, devoid of any empirical evidence, fed the illusion that tax cuts would be self-financing"
- 194 - friedman's agents had time lag, lucas eliminated time lag (very dumb)
- 195 - lucas said economy always at full employment and unemployment was just a change in equilibrium rate of employment (so 50% employment could be full)
- 196 - keynes: conventions are not shortcuts to calculation b/c calculation is often impossible
- 197 - new keynesians accepted rational expectations hypothesis and so gave up keynes's focus on uncertainty
- 199 - woodward: new synthesis discarded keyne's insights on uncertainty + instability; said micro should underpin macro while keynes disagreed
- 202 - "One cannot survey the story of the unravelling of the Keynesian revolution without being struck by the close link between economic theory and political ideology"
- 210 - lucas says policy can have real impact only if acts using information not known to the public (lol just look at covid, p clearly false imo)
- 211 - rational expectations simplifies computation b/c assumes all people have same rationality, information, preferences; only need 1 person now

## 8. the disablement of fiscal policy
- 219 - on assertion that central banks saved global economy: "This is sloppy journalism." -> neglects massive fiscal policy
- 230 - fiscal multiplier underestimated b/c using pre-crash estimates
- 231 - "entombed in tortuous econometrics and technical jargon", "This was as near as their prose allowed to admitting that they had been using the wrong model ... On such foundations policy was built and lives blighted"
- 232 - 90% debt gdp barrier wrong, "Reinhart and Rogoff explained lamely"
- 235 - non-eu govts can have central bank buy securities instead of individuals
- 240 - blanchard + summers: policy that minimizes recession minimizes loss of potential output
- 241 - us was keynesian, had continued growth despite rhetoric for austerity
- 245 - "In reality, the only deficits the deficit-hawks really mind about are deficits incurred to protect the poor. The wealthy have never been against tax cuts for themselves, even if this widens the deficit; and their economist friends have been busy demonstrating what wonderful multipliers are available for the economy if governments take this course. To cut the deficit for the poor and expand it for the rich - what more could one ask of government fiscal policy?"
- 246 - pettifor: bond market keeps govt honest

## 9. the new monetarism
- 250 - qe boosts asset prices, allow mortgage extension to finance higher consumption; higher share prices -> increase wealth -> increase spending
- 252 - central bank commitment to low inflation may not have caused low inflation, more likely price drops b/c labor mkts expanded to asia
- 259 - amount of money spent affects prices, not amount of money created (does this mean asset prices are doomed to fall?); qe depended on wealth effect, not direct causation; keynes would say fiscal policy is the answer
- 263 - qe was expected to boost amount raised from public markets
- 266 - negative rates will cause flight into cash
- 269 - bank of england in 2016 said asset purchases on their own didn't boost activity, but their effect on sentiment did
- 272 - richer households less likely to consume, qe enriched wealthy households -> smaller impact on overall spending
- 273 - "In practice, the [central] bank's accountability is to the financial system, which means to existing asset owners"
- 275 - "But the ECB's passivity also reflected a particular historical mindset. For the ECB, heir to the Bundesbank, the supreme danger to avoid was a repetition of the hyperinflation of the early 1920s. By contrast, it was the Great Depression ... which had the biggest historical impact on Ben Bernanke and other US policymakers."
- 275 - "Governments whose policies fail to achieve their promised results *always* claim that they were pursuing policies that would have succeeded had it not been for unexpected 'headwinds'"
- 277 - "QE offers as good an experiment in macroeconomic policy as we are likely to get, which is not that good. Attempting an empirical assessment of its effects is bedevilled by the omnipresence of counterfactuals"
- 278 - 08 collapse showed you need to do more than keep price stability
- 284 - bubbles do not sort themselves out
- 287 - if qtm were correct, there would be no need for fiscal policy, but it has a lot of leaks so "dogmatic rejection of fiscal policy seems indefensible to me on scientific grounds"

## 10. distribution as a macroeconomic problem
- 292 - on distribution: "A clearer example of economics tracking politics would be difficult to find."
- 294 - monopolized scarce resources give opportunities to extract rents
- 302 - chris giles tried to discredit piketty, "His attempt to discredit Piketty failed, but it shows Piketty had hit a raw nerve"
- 305 - financialization of economy destabilizes by allowing debt to replace earnings

## 11. what was wrong with the banks?
- 307 - Volcker in 2011: "It should be clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations, market efficiencies, and the techniques of modern finance"
- 310 - "Central bank models were based on a neo-classical fantasy world"
- 313 - efficient market hypothesis is trash; "A dose of realism, or even a cursory knowledge of history, would have told these savants that markets do not work in this way"
- 313 - "despite its garling theoretical gaps, the EMH became the intellectual underpinning of financial market regulation"
- 315 - value at risk models (VaR) -> "VaR measures assume that we have the correct probabilities for all future outcomes. This is a risible assumption"
- 315 - "humans do not face a knowable distribution of probable outcomes; we face genuine, radical uncertainty
- 319 - free capital flow between nations might not be good, even IMF says so
- 323 - assumed that mbss were far safer than individual mortgages b/c they were independent of one another; terrible assumption, heavily correlated
- 324 - far more credit default swaps than underlying assets, so no way to get paid back
- 325 - banks forgot insurers could go bust, insufficiently offloaded risk
- 329 - credit rating agencies are paid by people getting rating, so bad incentives; also didn't recognize correlation in securitized products

## 12. global imbalances
- 336 - money was flowing from capital-poor country (china) to capital-rich one (us) -> this was supposed to be impossible
- 338 - dollar is reserve currency which explains both accumulation by china and low fed interest rates
- 339 - pettis: china under-consumes b/c unequal income -> treasury accumulation
- 341 - "The structural flaw in the EU's Single Currency Area was obvious from the start; it was a monetary union without a political union."
- 343 - "As with any dispute between debtors and creditors, appointment of blame is, ultimately, a value judgement, which cannot be settled by accumulating facts"
- 344 - economists advocated for deregulation b/c EMH -> credit expansion instead of public redistribution -> bad bank behavior -> 08 collapse

## 13. reinventing political economy
- 359 - "Few economists can resist a correlation which seems to confirm their theories" -> better explanation for great moderation is cheap chinese goods
- 360 - "the trade-off between inflation and unemployment ... should be a matter of political judgement" + central banks shouldn't control interest rates (yikes!!! not great!!! very much disagree there!!!)
- 366 - most credit created by banks used to speculate on assets instead of on producing new things
- 367 - "An aspect of financialization little discussed in polite circles is the extent of its criminality" -> middle eastern and russian cash
- 373 - "An economics which both minimizes the possibility of non-material forms of flourishing and fails to deliver its own promised goods is ripe for populist demolition"
- 373 - a market usually needs a state to curb its excesses, but "we have been trying to create a unified global market by diminishing national states without setting up a global state, or even recognizing the need for one"
- 374 - neoliberal statecraft: "It scrapped or emasculated the protectionist features of the post-war order which made it politically acceptable. Enslaved by utopian theories and ignorant of history, the ideologues of the free market have been preparing the ground for the Apocalypse"
- 375 - first wave of globalization rolled back in 1914
- 377 - eurozone created in way that "reflected the view of neo-liberal economics that markets needed rules, not states"
- 377 - tim congdon says free trade is good, but "This is bad history, since many nations have prospered under Protection"
- 377 - arguments for free trade focus on long run: "It forgets that what happens in the short-run can blight the lives of a generation and, beyond that, those of their children"
- 378 - free trade model assumes full employment, but unemployment exists -> argument against free trade. "This is a good argument"
- 379 - "We should not forget that globalization was *intended* to depress wage growth in the developed world"
- 384 - mainstream economics lacks political legitimacy -> "mainstream economics has been indifferent to levels of unemployment and to the growth of inequality, holding that these may be the justified consequences of market competition, the 'correction' of which would only make things worse"
- 386 - "the attempt tot bolt macroeconomics on to the classical microeconomics must be judged a failure" micro -> how markets work, macro -> how they fail
- 389 - behavioral economics: "It surely doesn't need to be emphasized that such revelations come as surprises only to those who have literally taken leave of their senses."

## questions
- 17 - what precise mechanisms cause business cycles? is it actually prudent to look at long-term trends as cycles?
- 154 - figure 12 looks very suspect to me
- 166 - how much inflation needs to happen to be noticed? wrt to oil prices, did sudden spike cause high inflation in 70s b/c so many people saw a major commodity get more expensive?
- 204 - fig 20 -> is it possible for these slopes to vary over time, become one another?
