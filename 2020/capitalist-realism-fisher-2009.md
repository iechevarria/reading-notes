the following are my personal notes on capitalist realism. this is not a
summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## 1: it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism
- 2 - neoliberalism has relied on the state while ideologically opposing it
- 3 - exhaustion of the future does not leave us with the past
- 4 - power of capitalism is to render things "equivalent" via monetary value
- 4 - "Walk around the British Museum, where you see objects torn from their
    lifeworlds and assembled as if on the deck of some Predator spacecraft, and
    you have a powerful image of this process at work." (reminds me of graeber
    when he says you need to rip something from its context to turn it into a
    commodity)
- 7 - frederic jameson: failure of future would create postmodern cultural scene
    dominated by pastiche and revivalism

## 2: what if you held a protest and everyone came?
- 12 - anti-capitalism is widely disseminated in capitalism (very funny wall-e
    example)
- 13 - capitalism proceeds as well if not better without anyone making a case
    for it
- 13 - capitalism relies on system of disavowal: idea that what you belive about
    capitalism matters more than what you actually do
- 15 - "ideological blackmail" that caring indviduals could end famine directly
- 15 - project red: fantasy that western consumerism is solution, not cause of
    global inequality; "All we have to do is buy the right products"

## 3: capitalism and the real
- 16 - ideological position not successsful until it goes from value to fact
- 17- badiou: emancipatory politics must destroy appearance of natural order,
    reveal contingencies, also must show what is thought to be impossible is
    possible
- 20 - persistence of bureaucracy doesn't show that capitalism doesn't work,
    just shows that it doesn't work as it conceives of itself (fixation on
    bureacracy: also in graeber's work - is this disillusion w/ academia or
    something else? why does it keep showing up?)

## 4: reflexive impotence, immobilization, and liberal communism
- 21 - people know things are bad, but also 'know' they can't do anything about
    it: self-fulfilling prophesy
- 21 - students in "depressive hedonia" (very funny + grouchy description of
    kids these days)
- 24 - "The consequence of being hooked into the entertainment matrix is
    twitchy agitated interpassivity, an inability to concentrate or focus." (
    this I think may also be a result of school itself, the perpetual need to
    get things done, a true never-ending workday. I felt this in college)
- 25 - adhd "a consequence of being wired into the entertainment-control
    circuits of hypermediated consumer culture" (idk if hypermediated anymore,
    but if anything, it's gotten worse with individuals at the helm on youtube)
- 28 - liberal communists: offset capitalist excess with charity -> not
    progressive response, but core of capitalist ideology now
- 29 - david harvery: neoliberalism best understood as political project to
    allow capital accumulation + re-establish elite power
- 29 - "post-political" era has continued class war, but only fought rich
    against poor

## 5: october 6, 1979: 'don't let yourself get attached to anything'
- 31 - heat vs older gangster movies lol
- 33 - capitalism requires family (for new workers, as salve for conditions)
    even as it undermines it (denying time w/ children, pressuing couples to
    become only source of consolation for one another)
- 35 - pensions make worker torn between old-school class conflict and
    maximizing investment return
- 35 - capitalism feeds on and reproduces population moods
- 36 - mental health: 'selfish' capitalistic countries have higher rates of
    mental illness, encourage aspirations and expectations there are fulfilled
- 37 - mental illness as 'brain chemistry' -> atomistic individualism

## 6: all that is solid melts into pr: market stalinism and bureaucratic anti-production
- 42 - drive to assess performance of workers whose output is inherently tough
    to quantify causes more layers of bureaucracy; means more work goes into
    representations of work than work itself; value symbols of achievement over
    achievement itself
- 44 - not deviation from 'true spirit' of capitalism - value on stock
    exchange is generated more on perceptions of future performance than what a
    business really does
- 46 - big other: virtual figure that believes even when no individual does;
    example: when the jeweler said their products were cheaply made - people
    knew but the big other didn't, and then things crashed (reads a lot like
    plausible deniability)
- 46 - capitalism's rapacity depends on its ability to cloak itself, to present
    as socially responsible even if nobody really believes it
- 50 - "bureaucratic procedures float freely ... but that very autonomy means
    they assume ... a resistance to any amendment or questioning"
- 50 - auditing best understood as fusion of pr and bureacracy
- 52 - postmodern capitalism requires workers to engage in constant symbolic
    self-denigration that will never be acted upon

## 7: '...if you can watch the overlap of one reality with another': capitalist realism as dreamwork and memory disorder
- 55 - "it is precisely workers' subjective disinvestment from auditing tasks
    which enables them to continue to perform labor that is pointless and
    demoralizing."
- 61 - brown: "Plato theorized open compatibility between individual choice and
    political domination, and depicted democratic subjects who are available to
    political tyranny or authoritarianism precisely because they are absorbed in
    a province of choice and need-satisfaction that they mistake for freedom."
- 61 - neolibs and neocons had shared enemy: welfare state

## 8. 'there's no central exchange'
- 64 - great rant about call centers: "In this experience of a system that is
    unresponsive, impersonal, centerless, abstract and fragmentary, you are as
    close as you can be to confronting the artificial stupidity of Capital in
    itself"
- 66 - climate change: everyone is responsible for it, but this collective
    subject doesn't exist, but crisis demands it be constructed to address it
- 68 - would replacing banking class with 'better' people help things, no b/c
    trouble is structural (is it though? or is it the people who self-select?)
- 69 - see people who enter management who want to be better and then are
    subsumed, structure takes over -> mistake to blame individuals (is it,
    though? perhaps possible to impose at individual level?)

## 9. marxist supernanny
- 71 - "attack on postmodernity's permissive hedonism"
- 72 - parents work, don't want to be "oppressive" and tell kids what to do
- 73 - spinoza: standard human state is addiction, freedom can only be achieved
    when we apprehend real causes of our actions, set aside "sad passions"
- 75 - "interpassive simulation of participation" on facebook generates
    repetitive, parasitic, conformist -> bottom up culture infantilizes (lol
    wish i could see this guy's take on tiktok; my own take: tiktok is apex of
    hedonism. i've seen younger relatives become agitated w/o it, seen them
    habitually open the app)
- 76 - ironic that capitalism's "society of risk" makes media less risky than
    public television
- 77 - add stability so there's cultural vibrancy
- 77 - postmodernism is suspicious of single big causes, but this is all caused
    by capital
- 79 - anti-capitalism must be a rival to capital, not reaction to it; left
    should argue it can deliver massive reduction of bureaucracy (graeber also
    really into bureaucracy)
- 80 - tactics: teachers shouldn't strike, but they should resist self-
    surveillance that management can't work without but that doesn't help real
    education
- 80 - rid public services of business: "When even businesses can't be run as
    businesses, why should public services?"
