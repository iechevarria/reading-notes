the following are my notes on subprime attention crisis. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye. these are also the ideas that i plan to dispute.

## introduction
- 11 - page and brin worried about perverse incentives of internet ads in 1998 paper
- 12 - ads are a marketplace for attention - sold by platform, bought by advertiser

## 1: the plumbing
- 23 - ads more like oil than overhyped 90s tech stock bc ads are primary financial engine funding most media
- 28 - covid layoffs in newsrooms show media not able to weather brief periods of weakness in ads mkt
- 29 - philanthropic funding might stop if ads crash bc contraction of wealth in tech -> stupid thing to worry about
- 29 - are ads too big to fail? -> obviously not, didn't get bailed out by the govt, govt isn't buying ads to support media biz; is social media, search, video too big to fail -> totally misunderstands why banking is special + why banks can be too big to fail
- general - better investigation would actually follow cash flows instead of just supposing they'll drop and affect other things, actually lay out how dependent businesses are on these services (easy to do: look at companies who are SEO-dependent)
- general - to what degree are non-ad businesses sustained by ad revenue?
- general - also look at revenue for print journalism -> up and to the right until the 90s, nowhere near recovered
- general very surface-level comparison of ads with MBS in GFC

## 2: market convergence
- 35 - ads not most obvious way to make money on search - google thought they'd license their search technology
- 43 - moments of attention have been bundled into liquid (!) assets bought and sold frictionlessly (!) in global marketplace - attention is commodified
- 44 - standardization allows market to accomodate larger number of players
- 45 - abstraction: no longer ned to know specific characteristics to transact
- 45 - chicken allegory is nice
- 50 - IAB builds consensus in defining commodity attention
- 55 - cites reinhart and rogoff talking about boom and bust - come on dude, is there not anyone else who can address this better? (cough cough keynes, minsky, mehrling ... idk just not these two)
- 55 - heavy reliance on concept of market opacity without talking about specific mechanisms
- 56 - "Opacity allowed these toxic assets to trade at prices far above what they were actually worth" -> 1. they didn't trade often, they were made to be held! 2. insurance rates on MBS were used to impute value of underlying assets, they charged little bc AAA rating, thought it was free money 3. AAA rating came from securitization - underlying mortgages known to be junk! but judged unlikely to all fail at the same time ... they did
- 56 - explicit mention of expectations without actually getting that this matters bc continuous cash flows, debt needs servicing
- 56 - opacity allows inflation of market despite shaky fundamentals -> shaky fundamentals in MBS is cash flows can all blow up at the same time, and you're stuck with MBS on your balance sheet. shaky fundamentals in ads -> they don't work maybe? simply do not buy ads?
- 57 - "When a hot, overpriced commodity is discovered to be effectively worthless, panic can set in, causing the market to implode" -> dude no not usually how it works, usually when it's just less good than people imagine, it drops, then destabilizing force of credit makes it drop so low that it becomes effectively worthless (perhaps excessive price motion). if people find out it's effectively worthless, it's already over lol "usually" lol
- general - structural vulnerability is a matter of credit + its inherent instability + interdependent relations
- general - if a commodity is overpriced and it's discovered to be worthless, then by definition the market has imploded!!!
- general - structural issues in GFC != 'mortgages bad' -> it was web of interdependence + instability of credit

## 3: opacity
- 62 - complexity of financial instruments in subprime mortgage crisis made it hard to see that mortgages were likely to default -> lol no that wasn't the problem, problem was that they assumed they wouldn't all default at the same time. bad assumption! assumed independence between mortgages, got wrecked
- 67 - private marketplaces (PMP) getting more popular bc lack of brand safety on public marketplaces + lack of transparency make things riskier
- 68 - author asserts that PMP makes it harder to know right price to pay, but sounds like these are just fundamentally different products
- 70 - fb overreported video attention by 60-80%, media orgs pivoted to video chasing that revenue                                                       
- 72 - "This can allow irrational exuberance to push the prices of things far above their real value" -> need to define real value. it is not a given! also a pretty worthless thing to fight about. accept that things are worth what someone else will pay
- 72 - "opacity is a key precondition for market failure" man this sucks
- 73 - author himself states that advertising has never been so transparent - undermines his whole thesis that 
- 74 - "On its own, opacity doesn't create a financial crisis" lol yeah financial crisis is pretty unique pal
- 74 - "But if the underlying attention purchased online remains high quality nonetheless, the market might remain sustainable" <- really need to define that quality. sounds like author thinks there's some reference value that you can just derive ... but then what is the market doing lol? also perhaps the value you think exists isn't what you think it is, look at ads in hollywood, clearly not just for cash flow from ticket sales
- general - I assumed author means marginal benefit of an ad buy, but needs to lay that out

## 4: subprime attention
- 76 - "In financial parliance, both CDOs and online advertising inventory are derivatives - they derive their value from an underlying asset. CDOs draw their value from the mortgages they contain; online ad inventory draws its value from the attention that it represents." -> extremely dumb and wrong, literally defined how it's a commodity earlier. this is like saying that commodity corn is a derivative bc it's abstracted. all the more absurd bc true ad commodities are being proposed -> ad futures
- 77 - prices being pushed higher even as quality is bad, made possible by opacity of the marketplace "which allows real and market value to drift further apart over time." -> dude you need to posit the demand side here, just saying opacity doesn't explain why people are buying this stuff
- 78 - 1994 banner ads are 44% click-through rate, today around 0.4%
- 79 - 2009 study estimated 8% of users did 85% of clicks
- 81 - 2014 google study said 56% of ads never seen by a person
- 82 - wealthier people use more ad blockers
- 83 - some ads work for some contexts for some products
- 84 - 2018 adobe study said maybe 28% of users weren't human
- 85 - study said fraud 2x more common in video than display
- 87 - domain spoofing expands apparent supply of high-value audiences, juice demand for online ads, pump up size of mktplace
- 91 - "Financial crise ... can emerge even when players in the market know the risks of a growing bubble or the underlying weakness of a widely hyped asset." -> true, so why does opacity matter?

## 5: inflating the bubble
- 94 - "advertising budgets are pouring into this market bubble because they have nowhere left to go"
- 96 - subprime mortgages went bust "en masse" -> that's the important part!
- 96 - savings glut hypothesis: large flows of money seeking safe yield can cause bubbles
- 97 - finally defines perceived return on ads, should have opened with this
- 99 - movement of people to digital -> less reason to buy anything other than digital -> more dollars in digital -> degradation of non-digital -> acceleration of cash into digital; finally a feedback loop posited!!
- 100 - this produces a huge influx of cash into digital that has nowhere else to go -> kind of gets it backwards, first digital killed print, but took years and years to actually absorb the spend
- 100 - "Ad buyers are unlikely to cut their budgets significantly even as the number of options for placing those budgets declines" -> this is as the heart of it, need to talk more about the inflexibility here. demand side is most important imo!
- 101 - author posits a future where market incorporates risks of blocking / low attention and price changes -> seems like that's happening! rise of PMPs indicates awareness of quality problems IMO
- 101 - "But if the price fails to reflect reality, the price of the ads being bought and sold will remain stable as the real value of the underlying asset - attention - erodes." -> could really just replace this notion of real value of underlying asset with real return, much simpler ... but that would undermine the whole subprime mortgage crisis comparison. this is also a disembedding narrative. not a fan.
- 108 - demand side platforms (DSPs) buy inventory in bulk and then sell at 44-66% markup
- 109 - the guardian: 70% of money spent on ad buys goes to ad platform, remainder to publisher; author: this constitutes "perverse incentives to keep prices high and the market hot" -> actually they're just charging what people will pay! the publishers are getting screwed here - it's a rent, but it's not inflating the price of the ads. the price is what people will pay!! it's not like healthcare! you can simply not buy ads! also the buyers have no incentive to keep the prices high! whereas with MBS, you're holding that so you want it to retain value

## 6: exploding the bubble
- 115 - "Publishers want to streamline sales by providing a simple menu of attention inventory to buy. This requires that online platforms be actively architected in a way that standardizes user engagement and attention." -> really cool point. wish there was more like this
- 117 - broad range of expression that the internet could enable is limited to what can serve ads
- 117 - "In this sense, advertising is complicit in restricting the grammar of social interaction online."
- 117 - new entrants also have to conform with existing state of play
- 117 - "decisions made in the formative stage of the web limit what is possible in the future"
- 118 - strong ethical imperative to allow collapse of surveillance capitalism bc something better may follow
- 120 - "Like the banks during the subprime mortgage crisis, dense links between advertising-driven businesses and the rest of the economy mean that vulnerability in the attention marketplace may produce harm in other, less expected places" - goes on to only describe google products lol ... banking is very special, and author doesn't understand why; need a lot more evidence to say that it's similar structure to banks, need to follow cash flows
- 122 - bad loans in mortgage crisis caused global economy to go bust -> to compare this with ads is nuts. better comparison is shale - oil industry didn't collapse bc 100s of shale bankruptcies, much less global economy. single bad asset class doesn't cause total collapse
- 124 - reduce confidence in ad measurability - "If it turns out that the data collected by advertisers are not in fact accurate, or that the data are not in the end all that useful for shaping perceptions and behavior, then programmatic advertising is not 'better' in any real sense" -> don't rely on reality dude! make value judgements! just say it's bad!!
- 127 - direct action: distribute a bunch of bad data, manipulate ad bids, leak how bad it all is from within
- 128 - online advertising markeplaces intertwined with fate of broader economy -> needs a hell of a lot more justification
- 133 - perhaps force voluntary disclosures in ads, author says this would deflate the supposed bubble, might actually accelerate investment
- 135 - proposes standardized public statement to participate in ad market, exclusions from markets if a seller with a bad record
- general - seems like market has already chosen a way to self-regulate: PMPs, dunno if all this proposed machinery is necessary

## things to look up
- 4 - nico neumann how wrong audience targeting and ai-driven campaigns undermine brand growth
- 46 - william cronon nature's metropolis
- 53 - raghuram rajan has financial development made the world riskier
- 115 - james c scott seeing like a state
