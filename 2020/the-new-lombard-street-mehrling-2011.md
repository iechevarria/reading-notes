the following are my personal notes on the new lombard street. this is not a
summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## introduction
- 3 - operations of money market make modern credit system work, cash flows meet
    cash commitments; failure to pay one can cascade and cause further failure
- 4 - econ: look at present as result of past through veil of money; finance:
    look at present valuations as imagined future cash flows
- 5 - finance/econ obscure original bank task: balance elasticity and
    discipline in interbank lending; both treat liquidity as free good
- 6 - finance/econ say interest is about time, not price of liquidity
- 7 - wicksell: bank rate should match "natural rate" of interest; credit has
    inherent stability that bankers mismanage
- 8 - money view: instability natural for credit markets; bagehot's "money does
    not manage itself"; central bank that only tries to eliminate liquidity
    constraints exacerbates instability b/c participants lose discipline
- 9 - taylor/wicksellian policy too biased toward ease; ease was impossible
    in bagehot's time b/c gold standard
- 9 - return to gold standard doesn't fit today's needs, too much discipline

## one: lombard street, old and new
- 13 - distinction between speculative and productive credit hard to draw
- 14 - central bank general power comes from ability to control price and
    availability of funds in times of necessity
- 14 - historically, art of central banking was controlling short-term interest
    rate - cost of putting off payment that is due today
- 16 - if you don't catch a bubble early, it can be impossible to do anything
    using interest rate policy
- 16 - larger a bubble grows, larger the distortion in allocation of credit and
    real resources commanded by that credit - increase everyone's interest rate
- 17 - on the way up, central bank lacks traction b/c everyone avoids central
    bank discipline; on the way down, they become lender of last resort; used
    wisely, prevents downturn from becoming rout; used unwisely, continues
    bubble
- 22 - bagehot's high rate of interest limited funds to those in most need but
    also protected gold reserve from excessive drain
- 25 - fed doesn't lend/borrow on federal funds market, so rate fluctuates based
    on supply and demand; fed uses treasury repo market to control supply of
    underlying deposits that are borrowed/lent on federal funds market
- 26 - private dealers borrow on money market to finance market-making in
    capital markets, so funding liquidity becomes market liquidity
- 27 - fed today is always lending freely, but only to primary dealers, against
    treasury collateral, at repo rate
- 27 - in crisis, this system broke down b/c in private market, collateral was
    marked to market, not fundamental value (? what is fundamental value ?)
- 28 - extend lender of last resort to dealer of last resort: give borrowers +
    lenders what they want but at much worse prices than if they met each other
    on their own; basically central bank should have wide bid-ask spread

## two: origins of the present system
- 34 - speculative credit was source of liquidity for most american banks before
    the fed b/c banks relied on "shiftability" of portfolios in liquid markets
- 37 - treasurys, not commercial loans became the shiftable assets that provided
    liquidity for the entire system
- 42 - fair-weather shiftability inflated values on the way up, deflated values
    on the way down
- 42 - money market and securities market have always been intertwined and it
    has never been possible to distinguish speculative from productive credit
- 43 - monetary expansion wouldn't have prevented the great depression like
    friedman said; they needed to monetize bank assets but the fed saw these
    assets as inappropriately speculative
- 45 - banking act of 1935 allowed fed to lend against any sounds asset, so govt
    essentailly committed to making all sound assets equally and fully liquid

## three: the age of management
- 48 - 1937 federal open market committee meant fed would proactively buy/sell
    securities in open market, provide shiftability itself
- 60 - great depression showed that decentralized market system can fail
- 63 - tobin: no reason to think a single variable (money stock / interest rate)
    can capture policy / events - potshot at monetarists + bankers
- 64 - tobin: all assets assumed liquid, but only money riskless
- 65 - "Since the ideal was a world in which liquidity is a free good, it seemed
    to follow that the job of the Fed was to supply liquidity as a free good."
- 68 - minsky: credit-financed spending creates income for others -> raises
    asset prices, improves creditworthiness -> cycle continues
- 69 - minsky:  use collateral policy to discourage speculative financing
    structures - only hedge structures will be eligible for discount in crisis
- 69 - minsky was too pessimistic about markets for monetarists, too pessimistic
    about management for keynesians; continuous with central banking thought

## four: the art of the swap
- 73 - currency swaps were made to get around capital controls, originally
    coordinated between two firms with subsidiaries in different regions
- 74 - swaps eventually coordinated by intermediate firm
- 75 - swaps became a way of simply pricing loans, borrowing in whatever
    currency was cheapest for them, they swapping into currency they need
- 80 - credit default swap (CDS) is like bond insurance, so if your bond goes
    bad, you get a treasury or cash equivalent
- 81 - interest rate swap (IRS) is insurance in case rates rise
- 82 - swaps are implicit IOUs, not real loans, so they don't get regulatory
    scrutiny - IRS seller is basically banking (borrowing short, lending long)
    but doesn't have support from fed or fdic
- 82 - modern finance relies on liquid swap markets
- 84 - CDS pricing should see liqudity risk distortion bc no natural hedge
- 86 - "But now empirical failure could be attributed to problems with reality,
    not problems with theoryâ€”to continuing inefficiency in market operation, not
    to counterfactual theoretical abstraction from liquidity risk."
- 89 - regulatory arbitrage got popular, money market mutual funds started doing
    bank-like stuff but a little differently to get around regulation, then
    regulation got weakened, and financial innovation was accepted
- 90 - lack of institutional rigidities allowed fantasy of free liquididty
- 91 - monetary policy became devoted to making liquidity a free good, led to
    excessive ease that speculators used for profit

## five: what do dealers do?
- 96 - spreads between repo rate, fed rate, eurodollar rate typically very small
    and are often ignored, abstracted to a single rate of interest that fed can
    control; during crisis, spreads widened to 100 basis points+ b/c you need
    acceptable collateral for repo borrowing, so you need to bid up LIBOR
- 99 - fed is backstop to dealer system through daily ops in repo market and
    indirectly through lender of last resort function
- 101 - theorized world of EH has no survival constraint, liquidity risk,
    liquidity premiuim, no dealers
- 102 - monetary policy today affects behavior of dealers by pushing around
    asset prices, not bank lending
- 103 - money market intervention affects price of corporate bonds, MBS, and
    foreign securities; commitment to low fed rate means dealers expand balance
    sheets -> increased asset prices today
- 106 - even if fed guarantees funding liquidity, that doesn't create market
    liquidity; assets shiftable to Fed will be most liquid, but other assets are
    only liquid if some dealer will make profit
- 106 - in crisis, fed creates the market liquidity
- 111 - if fed makes funding liquditiy too cheap, market liquditiy becomes too
    cheap -> asset price bubble; low funding rates support high asset prices,
    especially assets without two-way dealer (like housing)
- 111 - "excess liquidity may have little effect on the price of assets that are
    already liquid, and the most effect on the price of assets that are most
    illiquid"
- 112 - "Abstracting from money may make our economic theory easier, but it does
    not make our economic policy better."

## six: learning from the crisis
- 113 - "any new system must grow organically out of the old one. We are not
    going to start from scratch, so our reforms had better engage with the
    system as it is, not as it was or as we might wish it to be in some ideal
    world."
- 115 - central lesson of crisis is that fed needs to be dealer of last resort,
    not just in money market but also in capital market, not just for treasury
    securities but also for private securities (rona did it!)
- 118 - shadow banking solvency + liquidity risk wasn't backstopped by govt
- 118 - "Widows and orphans are presumably not holding ABCP and RP, so maybe we
    can dispense with deposit insurance"
- 119 - "Since the role of deposit insurance is to prevent bank runs, it was not
    really surprising that the uninsured shadow banking system turned out to be
    vulnerable to runs."
- 120 - "when the music stops you want the government to be your counterparty"
- 124 - fed balance sheet expanded on both sides -> dealer in money market
- 125 - "Simply knowing that the Fed ws there as a backstop made others willing
    to deal privately inside the Fed's bid-ask spread"
- 125 - private funding liquidity disappeared b/c collateral; bad loans were
    definitely made, but money view says price about market liquidity
- 126 - security tranches were designed to be held, so limited trading -> where
    do prices come from?
- 127 - source of liqudity (hence price) was insurance on these assets / on
    assets of similar risk; banks made markets for CDSs -> source of liquidity
    for entire system -> prices on CDSs used to value underlying assets; banks
    ran into trouble, pulled back from market making -> liquidity contracted,
    prices slumped
- 128 - insurance industry insured AAA tranches thinking they were getting
    something for nothing, but this protection was essential to system b/c it
    allowed dealers to square CDS books + provide market liquidity; insurers
    didn't realize they were selling liquidity
- 129 - insurers + banks supplied marekt liquidity; insurers thought they were
    dealing in low-probability risk but actually were dealing as private dealer
    of last resort, sold liquidity at too generous a price
- 130 - dealers thought they had matched books, but were actually spreading
    market liquidity from high tranches to low tranches, taking on liquidity
    risk
- 130 - "insurance companies were writing contracts that they never should have
    been permitted to write"
- 130 - "Dealers thought they were taking no risk because they were calibrating
    their models using historical asset prices. In fact, however, their
    willingness to write those insurance contracts was changing the world,
    enabling great pockets of leverage to build up that would pose a problem
    of systemic risk that would overwhelm their private risk-bearing capacity."
- 134 - new fed principle: "insure freely but at a high premium"
- 134 - fed was insuring not payments that debtor had promised but market value
    of the promise itself

## conclusion
- 137 - funding liquidity is not enough, doesn't get translated to market
    liquidity; fed should not set market price, but set a price floor which is
    below market in normal times
- 138 - fed's job is to bound risk, not eliminate it (and with it profit)
- 138 - fed wants to bear liquidity risk, not credit risk, so last resort price
    may need to be far from market price
- 138 - dealer of last resort is about shiftability, not preventing wealth loss

## things to look up
- 12 - ralph hawtrey on inherent instability of credit
- 52 - jmk + john hicks on normal backwardation
- 59 - john g gurley + edward s shaw book money in a theory of finance
