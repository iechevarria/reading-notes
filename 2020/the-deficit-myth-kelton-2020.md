the following are my notes on the deficit myth. this is not a summary. instead,
these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye. in this case, i'm
quite familiar with the subject matter, so i don't have many notes. 

## 1: don't think of a household
- 19 - currency issuer should not have convertability or debts in other
    currencies
- 25 - tax creates demand for currency, incentive for population to do work for
    the state
- 36 - govt doesn't need to borrow money, it's a choice to offer interest
- 38 - paygo is dumb and easily gamed - gop just made optimistic predictions
    about growth to say tax cuts would pay for themselves

## 2: think of inflation
- 42 - only evidence of overspending is inflation
- 46 - cost-push inflation: supply shock, prices jump; demand-pull: people have
    more money and pay more
- 50 - interest rate used to change price of credit, regulate amount that people
    and businesses borrow + spend
- 51 - NAIRU non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment assumes some
    natural unemployment number, but fed errs on side of less inflation + less
    employment; millions unnecessarily locked out of employment
- 57 - keynes: can make credit cheaper but can't force anyone to borrow
- 62 - lerner: max boost comes from spending without taxing
- 68 - real min wage is $0 - to set it higher, need to have a real standing
    offer for employment at a positive price
- 71 - taxing rich people useful for political reasons, not inflation control

## 3: the national debt (that isn't)
- 83 - debt in china bc china gave us goods for USD - USD not actually from
    china
- 86 - greek debt crisis b/c they lost their ability to issue their own money
- 93 - govt can always override market on interest rate; happened in wwii

## 4: their red ink is our black ink
- 117 - purpose of selling bonds is "to prevent a large infusion of reserves
    from pushing the overnight interest rate below the fed's target level"
- 123 - fiscal deficits don't mean higher interest rate - look at wwii

## 5: "winning" at trade
- 135 - neoliberal strategy for winning is "structural reform" - pushing down
    labor costs to reduce production costs
- 143 - much of the world needs trade surpluses with US bc they have dollar
    denominated debt
- 149 - imf, wto, world bank all tell developing countries to do austerity,
    raise value of currency, get investors back, free trade, peg currency to
    dollar -> all of this is against monetary sovereignty

## 6: you're entitled!
- 169 - mcdonnell douglas plant in tulsa closed bc many employess were
    approaching retirement age, so they were killing the pensions. greasy,
    cynical stuff.
- 172 - 1880-1910 1/4 of budget was entitlements
- 178 - clinton welfare reform 1996 caused spike in extreme poverty. thanks bill
- 185 - social security could keep paying out benefits, it is only legally
    restrained from doing so when its fund is exhaused; medicare doesn't have
    the same restriction
- 190 - "The problem is a lack of vision"

## 7: the deficits that matter
- 213 - fha kept black americans out of suburbs bc they thought it would make
    white homes lose value; "Americans' racism and Americans' desire to keep
    their home values up combined in a self-justifying feedback loop."

## 8: building an economy for the people
- 261 - "Austerity is a failure of imagination - a failure to imagine how we can
    simultaneously improve living standards, invest in our nation's future,
    maintain a healthy economy, and manage inflation."

## general comments
- 212 - uncritically repeating ASCE talking points on infrastructure is a no-no
    in my book. oh D+, whatever - can't count on impartial assessment

## things to look up
- 3 - abbe p lerner functional finance
- 23 - warren mosler soft currency economics
- 104 - wynne godley
- 202 - elizabeth warren the two-income trap
