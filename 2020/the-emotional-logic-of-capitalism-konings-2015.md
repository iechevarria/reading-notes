the following are my notes on the emotional logic of capitalism. this is not a
summary. instead, these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye.

## introduction
- 1 - typical perspective: market has spun out of control, task of society is to
    limit consequences of unshackled markets (polanyian)
- 2 - polanyian thought accepts economistic account of economy, wants to use
    other parts of human life as independent factors
- 2 - economization is productive: organizes connections
- 3 - economy lets us grasp network of connections without having to retrace all
    details of its emergence
- 3 - money is relied on as objective fact even though it is just a social
    convention; is constructed so well that many parts work together
- 4 - only in critical mindset do we lose sight of constructive parts of economy
    and money, begin to see it as "merely constructed" and like idolotry
- 4 - disembedding critique looks past our daily experience with money
- 6 - groundless irrationality of idolater is fantasy of iconoclast, sign is not
    empty, and iconoclast is not above its influence b/c they try to break it
- 7 - idolatry critique is a way of externalizing problems and to legitimize our
    own investments in the sign by disavowing problems and saying they exist b/c
    the idolatry of others; do not demand less attachment to the sign but
    instead proper, nonidolatrous commitment
- 7 - modern subject doesn't transform own relationship to sign but instead
    makes fantasy of of corrupted other that did wrong and can't get the good
    from the sign
- 7 - "The modern subject tends to put iconoclastic sentiment at the service of
    its iconophilia"
- 8 - popular republicanism sees money / markets as source of corruption, looks
    to them as redemptive; say idolatrous subjects act wrong and stop money from
    being used as intended; these fantasies allow faith in purifying qualities
- 11 - neoliberalism: money mere convention, insist we do not fetishize it, need
    to make investments + honor debts -> combination of iconophilia and
    iconoclasm makes it easy to portray money as road to true republican self

## chapter 1: money as icon
- 15 - marxist + weberian: cash is corrosive, replaces human connection with
    cold calculation
- 16 - this is a "comforting plotline", "good story", not really helpful
- 16 - zelizer: money not uniform, used v differently based on social context
- 19 - polanyi: speculative credit boom -> claims w/ no basis in reality -> bust
- 19 - concern with money is not irrational, gives life
- 20 - we know in practicality what money is even if we have trouble formulating
    it conceptually
- 20 - money is iconic sign, embodies its meaning, communicates it significance
    but it is not clear how it does so, no correspondence between how it appears
    and what it does
- 20 - we immediately know what money means even if it's hard to delineate that
    meaning
- 21 - "In contemporary capitalism, money simply means social power; denying
    this is not so much a meaningful personal belief or a potentially effective
    attempt to resist the lure of a fetish, but rather the inability or
    reluctance to recognize a social fact."
- 24 - modern subject exaggerates past's irrationality
- 24 - traditional power required active endorsement of signs, required
    idolization; could not penetrate practical rationality, symbols remained
    external
- 25 - money has little inherent authority, depends on networks it's in; but
    influence becomes more deeply embedded in people; influence surpasses idol
- 25 - modern subjects develop organic affinities to icon

## chapter 2: affective signs
- 28 - "Capitalism, far from making authority anonymous and indifferent, makes
    things personal: it gets into our heads, becomes part of our identity,
    disposition, and desires, our basic sense of self."
- 33 - for affect to build, social life needs to be plastic - not so weak any
    outside influence will destroy its structure and not so strong it cannot
    change
- 35 - we take on roles when useful, but there are so many that we have to
    disavow some b/c at the moment we don't need alternative perspectives
- 35 - complexity of modern life means we don't know what's causing our problems
    so we often double down on existing routines / meanings that promise relief
- 36 - most often take on roles that validate our previous choices; any others
    would increase anxiety in short term
- 36 - authority comes from freedom b/c we see our limits, feel vulnerability
- 37 - when we feel anxiety about money, we move to get more; we don't
    reconsider our relationship to money, we intensify it
- 39 - traditional sovereignty ineffective beyond physical reach
- 39 - modern power comes from decentralization but points of centralization
    arise organically

## chapter 3: icon and economy
- 43 - economy used to refer to practical applied knowledge; then came to mean
    large-scale general order
- 43 - chresmatics, making money, not originally considered economy
- 44 - christian thinkers separated god's substance and practical activity
    between formal theology and economy
- 44 - christian conception of icon only created in response to accusations of
    idolatry
- 45 - icon is a mere symbol whose nothingness serves to remind insufficiency of
    earthly life
- 45 - effect of sharper distinction between divine / earthly was intensified
    regulation of humanity by human-made symbols; paradoxical
- 46 - church's stance on usury motivated by fact that moneylending eroded
    pastoral economy; much more concerned with common people seeing usury than
    financiers lending to each other
- 47 - church: chresmatics did not offer economy 
- 48 - adam smith's work on money analagous to church explanation of icons:
    awareness of money's constructed nature in no way diminished affective force
- 50 - iconoclasm doesn't annihilate economy, requires us to see status as human
    constructs -> become ever more embedded in life

## chapter 4: semiotics of iconocity
- 57 - icons take on anchoring role b/c they concentrate meaning of metaphor w/o
    explaining their history of how they work - a forgetting happens that isn't
    about loss of memory but of memorization + immediate identification
- 57 - consolidation means we can deploy signs immediately but beyond our
    consciousness
- 57 - impossible to unilaterally impose framework; need to link up interests w/
    other participants' identities
- 58 - once an icon is established, best way to claim authority is to link up w/
    it; metaphors most effectuve when they invoke institutionalized patterns;
    icon becomes "obligatory passage point"
- 58 - indexing practices to icons lets us tap into unquestioned legitimacy
- 60 - polanyian (and austrian) critique relies on credit expansion, but this
    portrayal of debt as derivative is wrong; credit preceded money, social
    obligation came first
- 60 - money is translation technology to make promises transferable and to
    allow them to circulate
- 61 - money: "we have to need to conceptualize it as a complex cluster of
    commitments but can approach it as an independent source of social power";
    credit them seems to come from moneys
- 62 - when investments go badly, externalize the problem to others' fetishistic
    irrationality
- 62 - american capitalism is simultaneous increase in complexity and
    organization; polanyian thought can't comprehend that economy emerges from
    complex internal connections
- 62 - populism: icononoclasm + iconophilia -> always accuse institutions of
    being captured by bad faith actors, but don't recognize this is permanent,
    believe it's a distortion

## chapter 5: economy in america
- 70 - early progressives didn't see themselves as opposing capitalism's ills
    or by injecting morality but instead as allowing inherent good to come about
- 72 - dollar arose not by destroying social fabric but by holding together
    credit connections
- 73 - credit expansion in early 20th century not driven by high finance but by
    consumer credit
- 74 - new deal didn't tighten credit or hold finance down, it expanded credit
    to ordinary americans; public authority strengthened not against but through
    economy
- 75 - iconoclasm + iconophilia after 1929: anger at elites who used markets
    wrong, not at markets themselves
- 77 - conceptual separation of economy from ethics and culture -> new emphasis
    on external morality -> political agency moves from ordaniry to elites

## chapter 6: lineages of progressivism
- 79 - central argument of the book is that the disembedding argument is
    inaccurate but also problematic way of dealing with capitalism
- 80 - progressive throught has never been able to deal with narcissism without
    reproducing the exact same externalizing logic; turned blind eye to internal
    complexity of narcissistic experience / reducing it to individualism
- 83 - progressive throught dealt with problems of the self by pathologizing
    them, not treating them as naturally part of human life
- 83 - "The troubles of the modern subject needed to be classified and managed,
    not penetrated and understood"
- 85 - Parson's framework abstracted people into easy cause and effect,
    predictable -> most problems can be treated as deviation from norm ->
- 87 - point of pathologization is to make things treatable
- 87 - progressives said new deal showed inherent vision in america but also
    that progressive destiny needed constant steering. contradiction!
- 90 - lasch: american public too far gone, but elites still had hope to be rid
    of consumerism + individualism; shows how elitist progressive thought became
- 91 - neoliberalism won in the 70s b/c it was more in touch with emotion

## chapter 7: economy and affect
- 93 - riesman: narcissim driven not by selfishness but by operating in complex
    network of associations; driven by anxiety inherent to modern social life;
    many options for role-taking cause insecurity
- 93 - uncertain sense of self, unable to get validation from within, subject
    tries to secure external validation; subject may recognize chronic
    dissatisfaction, but doesn't decrease effort to get external validation;
    organizes social environment to supress insecurity
- 94 - subject tries to turn elusive anxiety into objective facts, identifiable
    problems
- 94 - "Re-engaging the very norms, symbols, and institutions that are at the
    root of its problems, the subject dampens the intensity of its anxiety by
    sustaining the mechanisms that produce it."; emotional economy governed by
    logic of wounded attachment
- 95 - committing to icon isn't selling out, it promises improved, more
    authentic self.
- 95 - "The icon's distinctly secular yet highly spiritual promise is that we
    can have a better version of our current self, our present attachments and
    identity, without the anxiety." -> epitomized by money, always problem +
    solution to a problem; nothing money can't buy, so no amount is enough
- 95 - role-taking causes us to seek authentic self distinct from mere role
    play; makes us receptive to idea we have a more authentic self
- 96 - pre-modern people would not buy that there was a truth "within" them,
    that would be divine
- 96 - "The promise of authenticity thus plays on the prospect of perfected
    immanence rahter than transcendence, 'the promise of afterlife in one's own
    life'"
- 96 - intense faith in icon, permanent doubts + disappointments reinforce that
    faith
- 97 - modern trauma paradoxical: undeniable but does not appear to have
    objective cause
- 98 - "We make our anxiety sustainable, simultaneously mitigating its effects
    and preserving its existence"
- 100 - riesman's narcissists were agreeable, probably excessively so
- 101 - riesman was skeptical of view that modernization was colonizing social
    ties; he thought these views judgmental, incapable of analyzing why people
    participate in existing order
- 102 - fromm: public signs, institutions were symbols around which social
    control organizated -> not causes but rationalizations of emotional
    investments
- 102 - "Capitalism capitalizes on our inability to locate the sources of our
    anxiety and enjoins us to address our trauma by passing its effects onto
    others" -> capitalist therapies solve our problems by causing trouble for
    others
- 104 - capitalist subject creates fantasy of undeserving other; willfully
    suppresses contradictory knowledge
- 105 - fromm: capitalist order creation not dreary submission but spirited
    search for opportunity + self-improvement
- 106 - "It was this logic of accumulating resentment that neoliberal discourses
    would put to productive use, presenting themselves as reviving the tradition
    of populist republicanism against the pernicious influence of progressivism"

## chapter 8: neoliberal economy
- 107 - neoliberal financial expansion didn't come from consumerism (hedonism)
    but from anxiety over stagnant growth + rising unemployment
- 108 - neoliberalism "not only instructed people to tighten their belts but
    also gave them permission to impose such discipline on others, so creating
    new outlets for the modern subject's discontent"
- 110 - neoliberalism: problem not with money but with liberal-progressives
    idolatrous attitudes toward it; didn't ask for people to stop financial
    desires
- 110 - progressive austerity -> unthinking emotional stance; neoliberal
    austerity -> purifying, a way to build a blaming cult
- 111 - hilarious: "A recurrent theme of one of neoliberal America's key
    cultural institutions, the "Oprah Winfrey Show," is the notion that the
    posession of money is merely a function of spiritual worth, a measure of our
    willingness to be our truest selves, a sign that we have realized our
    calling and so actualized our immanent conneciton to the invisible"
- 112 - "This sadistic streak of neoliberal financial governmantality is richly
    present in the contemporary self-help eothos, and especially in programs
    like the 'Dr. Phil' show, a spin-off of 'Oprah'"
- 112 - "Austerity, toughness to self and others, appears as the road to
    redemption"
- 114 - polanyian though emphasizes externality of economy + social when they
    are actually more intertwined than ever before; workings operate with less
    external enforcement
- 116 - critics of hayek have pointed out that he overlooks the fact that we are
    perfectly capable of communicating in nonmarket settings
- 117 - volcker rate hike caused manufacturing crisis, sped deindustrialization
- 117 - monetarist policy caused increased credit demand; anxiety provoked by
    policy demanded debt; capitalism wanted more indebtedness
- 119 - modern citizen always expected to have debt; being without debt is a
    pain
- 120 - polanyian thought keeps trying to predict final crisis of neoliberalism
    (as do austrians)
- 121 - "Capitalist power increasingly works not through bypassing or paralyzing
    democratic sentiment but through shaping it"
- 122 - each crisis deepens economy, expands markets; no clear way out of
    hegemonic structures, so we need to propely deal with them
- 127 - neoliberal populism (tea party) see austerity as redemptive
- 128 - rise of polanyian thought is symptom of impasse of progressive thought;
    they don't want to deal with emotional reality of economy and just want to
    subjects to reduce anxiety to empirical problems
- 131 - this book looks at economy not as problem to be solved but as emotional
    experience
- 132 - book ends on a pitch for marxist theory 

## general comments
