the following are my personal notes on the code of capital. this is not a summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## 1: empire of law
- 8 - new york state and english common law dominate world of capital, also have largest financial centers
- 9 - global capitalists can pick and choose laws that are favorable to them without having to invest in politics to bend law
- 9 - empire of law severs connection between self-interest and society
- 9 - adam smith's invisible hand was predicated on need to stay at home to know local institutions, but today can receive legal protection anywhere
- 12 - northern investors lent against slave collateral, helping sustain slavery
- 12 - john commons: law enhances reliability of others' expected behavior
- 15 - money is backed by coercive power of state to impose liabilities on its citizens, this gives it value
- 16 - "When trade and commerce take place primarily within tightly knit communities, formal law enforcement may not be needed" -> sounds like a strong explanation for quaker and jewish presence in early banking
- 18 - more diverse assets + uneven distribution means more need for coercive law enforcement
- 19 - author's claim: legal coding accounts for value of assets, thus for wealth creation + distribution
- 20 - "States benefit from economics growth, because it boosts their tax revenue and allows them to raise debt finance" ???? what ???? not anymore
- 22 - asset holders do not need to capture the state directly, all they need are lawyers to code assets in law (contra marxists)

## 2: coding land
- 32 - lawyers in england 4x between 1578-1633 and they came from same social ranks as clients, so shared worldview
- 32 - land sales increased at the same time, prices 2.5x over 50 years by 1610
- 34 - at home, landowners relied on seniority, but in americas, they justified ownership with improvement to get land from first peoples
- 36 - fearing creditors, landowners enlisted lawyers who found the entail concept made land subject to strict family settlement
- 39 - land reform in england turned land into ordinary asset and 20% of land changed hands in 20 years after reforms
- 40 - same reforms enacted in americas in 1732 but in 1881 in england - shows it was a matter of political will; most creditors of american landowners were english so shift of balance of power was ok
- 40 - after independence, american law adopted some of the old features
- 42 - european colonies with settlers got legal systems like the ones at home, became richer afterward; colonies w/o settlers got systems for resource extraction, stayed poor
- 43 - "by insulating assets from various groups of creditors, the trust works magic in enhancing their durability"
- 44 - trust protects assets, so serves those with assets, the wealthy
- 45 - coase: transaction costs ubiquitous, so initial allocation of property rights matter a lot
- 46 - asset holders want protection for wealth to endure, so they need durability that's universally enforceable - not doable with private parties, so need a powerful state + laws

## 3: cloning legal persons
- 53 - company can choose its jurisdiction today - didn't used to be this way, used to need to have real hq or ops there; optionality means it's now hard to make rules that run contra shareholder interest
- 55 - corporation features: entity shielding, loss shifting, immortality
- 57 - entity shielding causes credit expansion: 1380 emergence of partnership system in florence triggered credit boom
- 57 - separate legal entities for different parts of business can help creditors bc they can lend only to the unit they care about - don't need to monitor the rest of the business
- 59 - partitioning can shield parent from child's losses, so smart creditors require guarantee from parent company - only need to monitor part they care about but have stronger guarantee
- 59 - however, if parent fails, nobody is getting money back bc partitioning - fools creditors into lending more bc illusion of security while total debt becomes more opaque / difficult to monitor
- 61 - industrialization doesn't need limited liability - california only added ll in 1932; became global standard - indicates powerful interests behind it
- 63 - real losers of lehman bros were creditors, not shareholders
- 63 - counterparties in derivatives transactions were made whole while senior unsecured creditors got <20% of their claims
- 64 - only guarantee for govt bailout is threat that system will collapse without them (put option, rescue me or else)
- 65 - leverage at investment banks increased when converted from partnerships to corporate entities in 80s and 90s (skin in the game lol)
- 66 - early joint stock companies were explicitly temporary, pooled resources for a single voyage
- 67 - dutch east india company (VOC) had lock-in while english east india company allowed people to take cash out whenever; VOC expanded far more while english had shorter voyages, smaller investments to ensure liquidity for shareholders who could pull out whenever
- 68 - regulatory competition erodes state power over corporations bc corps can choose laws to suit them (+tax rate, regulation)
- 70 - normal people governed by "seat theory", need to get permission + actually be in a country; corps use incorporation theory to roam globe
- 71 - normal people can't choose tax rate; corps can just create legal entity in jurisdiction w/ low tax rate + book income to that account
- 72 - inversion merger: large company in high-tax area acquires small company in low-tax area, folds itself into small company to get lower tax rate; like green card marriage, but legal
- 74 - lehman needed to avoid EU rules, so created swiss subsidiary, routed credit exposure to that entity; entity mostly run out of london office, but this was legal bc UK adherence to incorporation theory
- 76 - "This willingness to bow to the interests of capital makes outright capture of lawmakers and law enforcers almost unnecessary."

## 4: minting debt
- 77 - state money locks value bc states don't have survival constraint
- 82 - capital coding strategies developed by transactional lawyers, only became case law when challenged, but in boom times litigation rare, so practice spread + became new way of doing business (minsky? that u?)
- 85 - regulators shocked when banks were sitting on tons of toxic mortgages when crisis struck; they held bc they needed to sell all tranches
- 86 - ratings agencies used same nomenclature for MBS ratings as govt + corp bonds - led to impression of similar quality
- 87 - ratings agencies successfully defended themselves against fiasco by saying they just offer opinions and should be protected by 1st amendment
- 88 - creditors can transfer claims without consent by debtor, reverse is not true (liqudity -> impersonal, sounds like graeber)
- 90 - dealer: provide liquidity and assume liquidity risk
- 95 - securitization: pool risk to reduce costs of credit
- 105 - LTCM invested in emerging mkts assuming they would not all move in the same direction (like mortgage crisis MBS); bet that yields of debt from emerging mkts and advanced mkts would converge + that debt was distinct
- 105 - "Far from designing a perfect hedge, LTCM had made just a single bet"
- 106 - "when it comes to debt markets, the mantra of free markets is flatly wrong ... private law too rests ultimately on state power"
- 107 - "Debt, the private money that has fueled capitalism since its inception, is coded in law and ultimately relies on the state to back it up. States should realize this and keep the inflation of private money under control, because the more they bend to the will of private debt minters in boom times, the more they will be on the hook when it turns out that the economy cannot sustain the debt burden they created."

## 5: enclosing nature's code
- 114 - people defend patents on genes by saying without it there wouldn't be profit and therefore discovery; background of BRCA proves contrary - lots of govt + private foundations who invested resources
- 114 - "Indeed, basic science tends to be funded by governments, not private companies, as the returns on this investment are highly unpredictable. Private entrepeneurs wait patiently for the discoveries that can be made profitable and, with the help of the legal code, can be turned into capital."
- 117 - some suggest that enclosure of knowledge in patents means fewer viable investment opportunities + investment famine
- 118 - "But the legal code of capital does not follow the rules of competition; instead, it operates according to the logic of power and privilege."
- 121 - 1974 trade act introduced system of advisory committees that embed industry interests in US trade policy; speaks of citizens, but most if not all are execs of corporations, not normal citizens
- 123 - WTO TRIPS extended patents globally, removed free access to know-how in less advanced countries
