the following are my personal notes on the code of capital. this is not a summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## 1: empire of law
- 8 - new york state and english common law dominate world of capital, also have largest financial centers
- 9 - global capitalists can pick and choose laws that are favorable to them without having to invest in politics to bend law
- 9 - empire of law severs connection between self-interest and society
- 9 - adam smith's invisible hand was predicated on need to stay at home to know local institutions, but today can receive legal protection anywhere
- 12 - northern investors lent against slave collateral, helping sustain slavery
- 12 - john commons: law enhances reliability of others' expected behavior
- 15 - money is backed by coercive power of state to impose liabilities on its citizens, this gives it value
- 16 - "When trade and commerce take place primarily within tightly knit communities, formal law enforcement may not be needed" -> sounds like a strong explanation for quaker and jewish presence in early banking
- 18 - more diverse assets + uneven distribution means more need for coercive law enforcement
- 19 - author's claim: legal coding accounts for value of assets, thus for wealth creation + distribution
- 20 - "States benefit from economics growth, because it boosts their tax revenue and allows them to raise debt finance" ???? what ???? not anymore
- 22 - asset holders do not need to capture the state directly, all they need are lawyers to code assets in law (contra marxists)

## 2: coding land
- 32 - lawyers in england 4x between 1578-1633 and they came from same social ranks as clients, so shared worldview
- 32 - land sales increased at the same time, prices 2.5x over 50 years by 1610
- 34 - at home, landowners relied on seniority, but in americas, they justified ownership with improvement to get land from first peoples
- 36 - fearing creditors, landowners enlisted lawyers who found the entail concept made land subject to strict family settlement
- 39 - land reform in england turned land into ordinary asset and 20% of land changed hands in 20 years after reforms
- 40 - same reforms enacted in americas in 1732 but in 1881 in england - shows it was a matter of political will; most creditors of american landowners were english so shift of balance of power was ok
- 40 - after independence, american law adopted some of the old features
- 42 - european colonies with settlers got legal systems like the ones at home, became richer afterward; colonies w/o settlers got systems for resource extraction, stayed poor
- 43 - "by insulating assets from various groups of creditors, the trust works magic in enhancing their durability"
- 44 - trust protects assets, so serves those with assets, the wealthy
- 45 - coase: transaction costs ubiquitous, so initial allocation of property rights matter a lot
- 46 - asset holders want protection for wealth to endure, so they need durability that's universally enforceable - not doable with private parties, so need a powerful state + laws

## 3: cloning legal persons
- 53 - company can choose its jurisdiction today - didn't used to be this way, used to need to have real hq or ops there; optionality means it's now hard to make rules that run contra shareholder interest
- 55 - corporation features: entity shielding, loss shifting, immortality
- 57 - entity shielding causes credit expansion: 1380 emergence of partnership system in florence triggered credit boom
- 57 - separate legal entities for different parts of business can help creditors bc they can lend only to the unit they care about - don't need to monitor the rest of the business
- 59 - partitioning can shield parent from child's losses, so smart creditors require guarantee from parent company - only need to monitor part they care about but have stronger guarantee
- 59 - however, if parent fails, nobody is getting money back bc partitioning - fools creditors into lending more bc illusion of security while total debt becomes more opaque / difficult to monitor
- 61 - industrialization doesn't need limited liability - california only added ll in 1932; became global standard - indicates powerful interests behind it
- 63 - real losers of lehman bros were creditors, not shareholders
- 63 - counterparties in derivatives transactions were made whole while senior unsecured creditors got <20% of their claims
- 64 - only guarantee for govt bailout is threat that system will collapse without them (put option, rescue me or else)
- 65 - leverage at investment banks increased when converted from partnerships to corporate entities in 80s and 90s (skin in the game lol)
- 66 - early joint stock companies were explicitly temporary, pooled resources for a single voyage
- 67 - dutch east india company (VOC) had lock-in while english east india company allowed people to take cash out whenever; VOC expanded far more while english had shorter voyages, smaller investments to ensure liquidity for shareholders who could pull out whenever
- 68 - regulatory competition erodes state power over corporations bc corps can choose laws to suit them (+tax rate, regulation)
- 70 - normal people governed by "seat theory", need to get permission + actually be in a country; corps use incorporation theory to roam globe
- 71 - normal people can't choose tax rate; corps can just create legal entity in jurisdiction w/ low tax rate + book income to that account
- 72 - inversion merger: large company in high-tax area acquires small company in low-tax area, folds itself into small company to get lower tax rate; like green card marriage, but legal
- 74 - lehman needed to avoid EU rules, so created swiss subsidiary, routed credit exposure to that entity; entity mostly run out of london office, but this was legal bc UK adherence to incorporation theory
- 76 - "This willingness to bow to the interests of capital makes outright capture of lawmakers and law enforcers almost unnecessary."

## 4: minting debt
- 77 - state money locks value bc states don't have survival constraint
- 82 - capital coding strategies developed by transactional lawyers, only became case law when challenged, but in boom times litigation rare, so practice spread + became new way of doing business (minsky? that u?)
- 85 - regulators shocked when banks were sitting on tons of toxic mortgages when crisis struck; they held bc they needed to sell all tranches
- 86 - ratings agencies used same nomenclature for MBS ratings as govt + corp bonds - led to impression of similar quality
- 87 - ratings agencies successfully defended themselves against fiasco by saying they just offer opinions and should be protected by 1st amendment
- 88 - creditors can transfer claims without consent by debtor, reverse is not true (liqudity -> impersonal, sounds like graeber)
- 90 - dealer: provide liquidity and assume liquidity risk
- 95 - securitization: pool risk to reduce costs of credit
- 105 - LTCM invested in emerging mkts assuming they would not all move in the same direction (like mortgage crisis MBS); bet that yields of debt from emerging mkts and advanced mkts would converge + that debt was distinct
- 105 - "Far from designing a perfect hedge, LTCM had made just a single bet"
- 106 - "when it comes to debt markets, the mantra of free markets is flatly wrong ... private law too rests ultimately on state power"
- 107 - "Debt, the private money that has fueled capitalism since its inception, is coded in law and ultimately relies on the state to back it up. States should realize this and keep the inflation of private money under control, because the more they bend to the will of private debt minters in boom times, the more they will be on the hook when it turns out that the economy cannot sustain the debt burden they created."
- general - would love to see a similar treatment of landlording / real estate; the way this book examines law would lend a lot to that

## 5: enclosing nature's code
- 114 - people defend patents on genes by saying without it there wouldn't be profit and therefore discovery; background of BRCA proves contrary - lots of govt + private foundations who invested resources
- 114 - "Indeed, basic science tends to be funded by governments, not private companies, as the returns on this investment are highly unpredictable. Private entrepeneurs wait patiently for the discoveries that can be made profitable and, with the help of the legal code, can be turned into capital."
- 117 - some suggest that enclosure of knowledge in patents means fewer viable investment opportunities + investment famine
- 118 - "But the legal code of capital does not follow the rules of competition; instead, it operates according to the logic of power and privilege."
- 121 - 1974 trade act introduced system of advisory committees that embed industry interests in US trade policy; speaks of citizens, but most if not all are execs of corporations, not normal citizens
- 123 - WTO TRIPS extended patents globally, removed free access to know-how in less advanced countries
- 123 - international property rights spearheaded by US companies
- 125 - WTO law lets state retaliate if it doesn't comply with ruling - only useful to rich countries w/ lots of IP
- 128 - some patents give companies head start by allowing them to collect data for much longer than anyone else, useful bc trade secrets have no time limit
- 129 - "On one hand, US labor law endorses "employment at will," which gives employers great flexibility in firing workers, on the other, it allows employers to restrain employees' ability to re-deploy their skills."
- 130 - compares BRCA to pagerank - not a great comparison IMO bc 1) BRCA wasn't legit law and pagerank was 2) pagerank was a good start but ultimately not used anymore. not sure if being patented was really important. could have just used it as a trade secret and probably been fine
- general - patent -> timing advantage -> data moat; patent does not imply data moat, though it likely matters to some degree. patents hold less water in tech i thihnk, very common to be told not to look at patents (google's policy)
- general - discussion of tech and law could really use discussion of open source and licenses
- general - feels like this muddles patentable process / tech and business moats that aren't state-generated
- general - useful to discuss how hard it is to dislodge tech patents

## 6: a code for the globe
- 132 - solution to problem of global law satisfied by just using a single domestic legal system
- 141 - states held liable under international law for sub-units of federation where no federal jurisdiction exists, see metalclad case
- 142 - on eli lilly case: "The tribunal's willingness to entertain the cmoparison between Canadian, Mexican, and US courts suggests a bias in favor of investor interests over state sovereignty."
- 143 - professional arbitrators for international cases have incentive to hear cases that likely have no basis since they're paid one case at a time
- 147 - ISDA (swaps n derivatives group) made counterparties agree to pay out to derivatives traders before any other creditor; not really legal for existing bankruptcy laws
- 149 - bc of derivative privileging, other loans were structured as derivatives
- 149 - derivatives traders got money first in financial crisis; made crisis worse by cashing out immediately, reducing assets that could be used in reorganization; this was recognized as risk by BIS in late 90s
- 150 - states had to work together to impose rules on ISDA to fix netting out rules; ISDA adopted modified rules; states made market participants follow ISDA rules if they wanted to trade derivatives
- 152 - states used ISDA to regulate derivatives markets - "The fact that sovereign states had to co-opt a private business association, namely ISDA, to achieve their regulatory goals, indicates the extent to which states have lost control over the governance of global finance."
- 153 - ISDA first created contracts and then afterward lobbied states to make laws consistent with those contacts - opposite of expected
- 154 - contra marxists, not done by state capture but use law to wield statte power indirectly

## 7: masters of the code
- 166 - lawyers aren't rent seekers bc they create capital from assets; they dont think about societal effects, if they do, hope invisible hand will fix things. dont realize that they make invisible hand a fairy tale
- 173 - common law has advantages for coding capital bc earlier emergence of private lawyers, new law can be made and only occasionally vetted by court
- 174 - typo lol "970 attorneys per person"
- 177 - english law had advantage for international operation bc english colonies
- 177 - domestic US law fragmented bc states, makes US lawyers suited to operating internationally
- 180 - lawyers depend on state law but avoid courts bc this would put coding to the test
- 181 - "When cases are no longer vetted in the open, the law becomes stale and judges lose expertise, thereby giving lawyers and their clients even more reasons to avoid them."
- 181 - settlements benefit attorneys more than anyone because if there aren't cases that clarify the law, their advice will be needed more

## 8: a new code?
- 188 - immutable contracts are exposed to world's inherent uncertainty, could become bad
- 194 - no reason to think the blockchain is going to democratize anything; process of formalizing preexisting rights gives power to those with literacy
- 196 - DAO on etherium had a dumb structure - if it didn't blow up, it would have been subject to capital withdrawal bc no shareholder lock-in
- 202 - "only states can effectively back money, because only states have the power to unilaterally impose burdens on others."

## 9: capital rules by law
- 210 - contracts are inherently incomplete; cannot foresee all future possibilities + too costly to enumerate them; law's incompleteness makes it fertile ground for creativity
- 212 - law's malleability, indeterminacy makes it easy to game
- 214 - capital coders have first-mover advantage; practices can spread and become legitimate by spread
- 215 - "The representatives of the people fail to see or do not want to see that the additional benefits they shower on capital serves priimarily their individual holders, not society at large."
- 217 - capital coders prefer to work out of the public eye, prefer not to lobby for explicit legislative change unless totally necessary
- 222 - legal protection of capital is greatest of all subsidies
- 225 - fixes: default answer to new special regulations, tax treatments should be no; choosing most convenient legal system should be more difficult; conflict-of-law rules can be rolled back one state at a time since no treaty exists; rolling back choice of place of incorporation would do more against tax shelters than blacklisting countries that have low tax rates
- 226 - no more arbitration except between peerss
- 226 - typo! "legal modules necessary for converting simple into capital assets"
- 227 - allow affected parties in crisis to seek damages afterward, make them large amounts for deterrence
- 229 - "one of the major lessons of coding capital is that persistent incrementalism has advanced the interests of capital holders; persistent incrementalism, I suggest, may also be a viable strategy to push back and ensure that democratic polities may rule themselves by law."
