the following are my personal notes on money: the unauthorized biography. this is not a summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## 1. what is money?
- 14 - "Coins and currency ... are useful tokens to record the underlying system of credit accounts and to implement the underlying process of clearing."
- 14 - currency is not money, money is system of credit accounts
- 16 - knights of malta on copper coins when gold / silver rang low wrote motto: "Not the metal, but trust"
- 17 - coins dominate study of history b/c they physically survived
- 18 - english tally sticks hard to counterfeit b/c unique wood grain
- 18 - took 50 years to get rid of tally sticks (1782 to 1834)
- 20 - tally sticks destroyed, with them, tons of financial history
- 25 - ireland worked without money for 6+ months in 1970 using personalized credit system b/c banker strike
- 26 - worked in ireland partially b/c personal trust in country
- 27 - money has 3 fundamental elements: 1) abstract unit of value 2) system of accounts 3) ability to transfer between people
- 29 - irish story shows state not necessary for money to function (chartalism)
- 29 - what matters: issuers are creditworthy + belief obligations can transfer

## 2. getting money's measure
- 33 - money not a thing, but social technology
- 40 - neat descriptions of ancient myths on language, usually from gods
- 42 - mesopotamia initally kept track of things with physical tokens, checked that quantities matched; eventually moved from 3d objects to 2d depictions on slate; then to symbol with number

## 3. the aegean invention of economic value
- 54 - economic value a property of social world
- 58 - medieval people used different units for different contexts, so they had many units for the same physical properties
- 62 - first known coins minted in lydia and ionia in 6th century bc

## 4. the monetary maquis
- 68 - private notes were 1/3 money in argentina
- 69 - ireland worked with people to help things along without money, helped prepare, saw it coming; argentina was the one that closed the banks, so private money was against the state
- 71 - 40% of russian trade with private money by 1997, many private tokens
- 72 - private money a threat: credito -> continental dollar -> political revolt
- 78 - guanzi: money a tool of govt to regulate people's activity; basically had quantity theory of money
- 79 - seigniorage = money printer go brrr
- 79 - guanzi: sovereign should retain sole control of money, otherwise it loses power

## 5. the birth of the money interest
- 84 - after ad 300, banks disappeared from rome: not enough political / social stability for them to work (cough cough)
- 88 - crying down: saying coin is now worth less than used to be; distinct from debasement which is using cheaper metals for same value coin
- 92 - oresme, trying to convince sovereign not to touch currency too much: money belongs to the rich because they use it

## 6. the natural history of the vampire squid
- 103 - most risk-averse banking is short-term trade financing (sounds like mesopotamia in debt)
- 106 - bill of exchange: money token that was accepted at merchant houses + was denominated in abstract unit made by bankers, Ã©cu de marc; needs to be exchanged into sovereign currencies

## 7. the graet monetary settlement
- 115 - bankers needed a lot of trust to operate private money network; bankers have no force to threaten with -> exclusive club

## 8. the economic consequences of mr. locke
- 130 - reward for olympic games was just crown of palm leaves, so idea that money has value just by convention came naturally
- 131 - locke: rights exist by nature, so theory of money had to be altered to be somehow natural also
- 134 - mandeville: individual greed -> aggregate prosperity
- 135 - "The new world being forged by this corporate and financial revolution clamoured to be explained and justified - and Mandevill's outrageous hypothesis appeared to do both at once"
- 136 - smith: vision of econ system that trended to equilibrium; gave justification for monetary society in econ + political terms

## 9. money through the looking-glasss
- 140 - respect for contract alone not enough for monetary society, but also absolutists wrt to contracts foment revolution (in context of versailles)
- 144 - locke said money just a measurement of previous metal -> "Locke's understanding of money led not to a new age of objectivity in economic affairs" -> actually just arbitrary prejudices -> "it covered their tracks with a veil of apparent scientific objectivity" (sounds like ideology)
- 145 - locke understanding of money paved way to market above all else -> paved way for moral disaster by policy makers
- 149 - excellent description of irish potato famine and economic reasoning for allowing it to happen; ecconomics claimed to reduce "moral and political justice to the mechanical application of objective scientific truths"

## 10. strategies of the skeptics
- 152 - midas myth about reducing everything to single dimension, money
- 155 - money is paradox: both relies on other people but also isolates us by reducing our relationships to financial

## 11. structural solutions
- 168 - law: sovereign issuer needs to be able to vary supply of money, so don't use gold standard
- 175 - law: make money users explicitly bear risks instead of having sovereign promise to pay; money was then a claim to the tax flows which are based on productivity which is uncertain -> money became equity, not debt
- 183 - state should keep an eye on structure of financial obligations, make sure it's fair -> need politics to determine that -> need law to enact

## 12. hamleet without the prince: how economics forgot money
- 186 - summers: econ had nothing useful to say about great recession
- 187 - summers: econ got very distracted
- 189 - many top banks were quaker firms; neat anecdote about bill brokers
- 194 - bank needed money, raised money by selling equity, but saw sell-off b/c company w/ similar name went bankrupt
- 198 - bagehot: trust at center of banking system
- 201 - bagehot: central bank is uniquely able to stabilize, effectively manages all the money
- 202 - central bank lends at last resort, prevents panic from self-fulfilling
- 203 - bagehot: last resort lend at high interest to prevent moral hazard

## 13. ...and why it is a problem
- 208 - money not a simple commodity b/c demand for it goes up in crisis
- 212 - keynes: supply creates its own demand (say's law) -> false b/c people save cash
- 221 - macroecons tools didn't include money, abstracted away from money

## 14. how to turn the locusts into bees
- 226 - solvent: assets > liabilities
- 229 - bear stearns went bust, wall st didn't freak out -> when lehman bros started failing, wall st thought you couldn't "shoot the brothers" -> govt let it fail -> widespread panic
- 230 - uk nationalization of northern rock looks like good policy now
- 230 - sovereigns put massive amounts of money into banks, total support ~25% of global gdp $14T
- 232 - govt became loss-bearer of last resort, not lender of last resort
- 233 - increased austerity b/c bailout cost
- 233 - banks got something for nothing
- 235 - banks changed in the late 70s: instead of allocating credit and keeping loans on their own balance sheets, they securitized loans, facilitating lending between entities
- 237 - wild description of lending chain
- 239 - traditional credit market transactions have fixed lengths, no guarantee of ability to sell prematurely
- 240 - new credit market obfuscated this w/ counterparties, promised cash on demand
- 240 - shadow banking had 2x balance sheet of traditional banking in 2008
- 241 - fed balance sheet expanded, analysts though inflation had to go up, but the money wasn't new, it had been in shadow system all along (interesting assertion, haven't heard this one before, though idk how true it is)

## 15. the boldest measures are the safest
- 245 - glass steagall said don't mix investment banking w/ normal deposits and lending; mcfadden act said don't open branches in different states ->  effictively size cap; both restrictions gone in the 90s
- 249 - money doesn't need to be fixed to be just, needs to be democratically flexible
- 250 - banks have short-term liabilities of fixed nominal value and long-term assets of uncertain nominal value -> no liquidity transformation occurs, instead about synchronizing payments in / out of balancce sheets -> banks fail when confidence in ability to do this wanes

## 16. taking money seriously
- 262 - locke probably motivated by sincere beliefs in Liberalism
- 263 - naturalistic reasoning makes it difficult to think critically about a topic (money in this case)
- 263 - caliming to explain social truths as objective truths of nature is self-reinforcing
- 265 - too much debt now -> maybe inflate it away or restructure
- 265 - ultimate goal of monetary policy isn't inflation / financial stability but a just and prosperous society
- 266 - monetary policy is political
- 266 - banking is like civil service b/c money is sovereign tool -> banks should be subject to "guidance of democratic politics"
- 267 - wants less intervention by restricting banks to be more stable
- 268 - narrow banking would stop money from permeating everything (very wishful thinking imo, still have uncertainty and cultural stuff)
- 269 - economics is political and moral, need to recognize that
- 272 - if money becomes useless to its users, they'll come up w/ alternative

## questions / critiques / comments
- 36 - realistic depiction of ancient greek society? seems dicey
- 52 - weird description of separate spheres of value
- 53 - difficult to parse description of economic value
- 58 - suspect description of how greece was uniquely ready for money - coinage didn't originate in greece, it came from like turkey i think (says so on page 62 actually lol)
- 60 - this account omits mesopotamia's silver and liquid debt tokens. seems off
- 63 - weaker than similar discussion in debt by graeber about how greek society reacted to money's introduction
- 64 - where is the state in all this? no citations either
- 73 - james madison so wrong it hurts: if people were good, government wouldn't need to exist -> wrong wrong wrong, if people were good, government wouldn't need to exist *for markets to work*. also govt helps with uncertainty - unless angels are omniscient, still useful
- 75 - does sovereign need credit?
- 81 - great to see mesopotamia representation
- 84 - "coinage forgotten as means of representing money" idk seems iffy - in debt, graeber describes debts denominated in long-lost currencies. does this just mean people didn't have coins?
- 90 - "why tax when you can print money?" -> this book shows that happened!
- 123 - verbose opening to chapter, again verbose on 127
- 137 - uncritical citation of reinhart and rogoff
- 141 - debt explores idea of relationships transforming into financial obligations better imo
- 180 - too abrupt end to a section, didn't finish telling the story - i get the weaving here, but i just want to know what happened
- 182 - "only democracy" can decide what's fair, can make decisions that last -> idk dude, i like democracy enough too, but this is pretty bold
- 305 - phenomenal bibliography, I wish more books had ones like this
