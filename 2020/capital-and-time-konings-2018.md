the following are my notes on capital and time. these do not constitute a
summary. instead, these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye.

## introduction: beyond the critique of speculation
- 3 - today's heterodoxy is past's orthodoxy with its critique of speculation
    despite the fact there are no foundations to fall back on; not speculating
    is not an option
- 4 - critique of speculation is intellectual dead end
- 5 - claimed that speculation erodes order when instead stronger ordering
    institutions emerge that can regulate value of currency
- 8 - value of a dollar cannot be defined as anything other than a dollar,
    operates as organizing force in complex system of obligations; it's self-
    referential
- 9 - value is performative and speculative, not passive representation
- 9 - speculation can "provoke the reality" on which it speculates, can
    "induce the production of facticity" (man it'd be great to have an example,
    is this how the art market is manipulated? is it how high-water marks at
    auctions make things more valuable?)
- 10 - there exists no objective formal representation of value; impossible to
    separate material from ideal
- 11 - because it's impossible to objectively measure value, value is measured
    all the time, constant valuation
- 11 - valuation is performative, not representation, aims to generate value
    claimed to be represented (sounds like vc here)
- 14 - value is result of its context (immanent) also shapes its context
    (constitutive)
- 14 - leverage (his definition): how we make our fictitious projections real,
    how we recruit labor that makes them happen
- 16 - leverage off uncertainty, which inherently exists, by inducing others
    to invest in your promises to hedge against their uncertainty; economic
    power is not just about knowing but being known, increasing world's
    exposure to and investment in your risk (get everyone in the s&p 500)
- 17 - banks turn unknowable future in to probabilities; money is time-storage
    device allowing us to keep options open; banks exist b/c uncertainty
- 18 - banks central to life -> valuation governed by logic of bailout and
    austerity
- 20 - 20th century welfare state not balance against capitalist market but
    central to its risk logic; integration of population into capitalism; new
    deal expanded measurement of people in terms of ability to provide revenue
- 21 - american state policies entangled in banking in way it saw as bad but
    still could not do anything about it; attempts to tighten credit would
    expand shadow banking + increase instability
- 22 - neoliberalism sees speculation as productive, means engaging uncertainty
    w/ logic of governance
- 23 - neolibs: money not about barter problem, but way to construct unknown
    future; uncertainty essential to value and coordination
- 24 - neolib reason about the hope of transcending uncertainty by using
    speculation
- 25 - neolib invokes "prospect of secure life to motivate the intensified
    engagement of risk" (music's playing, gotta dance)
- 25 - it's fantasy to believe accumulation of power is unnatural, uniquely
    corrupting, but savvy neolibs align themselves w/ this view
- 26 - large segments of population integrated into capitalist logic, state
    followed
- 28 - neolib policies aimed at preemption not prevention
- 28 - selective, informal too-big-to-fail replaced inflationary across-the-
    board support
- 29 - neolibs not naive about market efficiency but savvy w/ logic of
    speculation, bailout, austerity
- 30 - "The moment of bailout is characterized by an absence of meaningful
    choice: intense uncertainty about what the future has in store comes to
    coincide with a compelling certainty as to what needs to be done." 

## chapter 1: foundationalism and self-referentiality
- 32 - ironic and sloppy that critique of economism via speculation rests upon
    idea of real value, invokes foundations of econ
- 37 - polanyian critique is that expansionary tendencies are pure negative,
    alleged to be unsustainable in long run; fails to explain why it occurs

## chapter 2: constructions and performances
- 38 - those who critique economism accept that society is constructed but do
    not accept it's constructed "all the way down"
- 42 - performativity scholarship doesn't rethink core econ, appeals to econ
    foundations for 'true value'

## chapter 3: luhmannian considerations
- 45 - luhmann: any attempt to know if things are essentially mind or matter
    is hopeless, go back and forth; cannot hope to clarify role by reducing to
    one or the other
- 47 - self-referential spectrum: recognizing dependencies -> reproducing self
- 48 - system always under pressure to choose to do something, cannot
    transcend own point of view, must speculate, make decisions without all
    knowledge (sounds like administrative behavior)
- 49 - luhmann: "Speculation takes its cue from speculation"; anticipations make
    uncertainty manageable
- 50 - actors know they have similar constraints to other actors -> something to
    strategize around; "the outcome of our investments is to a large extent
    determined by the investments they induce, and so it is often much more
    important to be known in this or that way than to expand one's knowledge.";
    control in risk society comes from being known in context of uncertainty ->
    "the purposeful creation of uncertainty and insecurity can even be a source
    of advantage" -> force people to do what you do, "endogenous
    hierarchization"; order that doesn't eliminate uncertainty, capitalizes on
    it
- 51 - "We can improve our own prospects of persistence by associating ourselves
    with a larger, more powerful entity, even if in the process we increase its
    leverage over us"
- 52 - permanent pressure to seek out alliances, integrate into higher-level
    systems

## chapter 4: system, economy, and governance
- 53 - defining money positively is impossible, it's circular
- 55 - "if we could predict the future, money would be without value; but given
    conditions of uncertainty, money holds out the promise of a secure future"
    (was thinking about this w/ historical lens - roman tributaries probably
    didn't feel this way, but perhaps the roman state did; without uncertainty,
    just requisition resources directly; again not sure if this is about
    expending the resources to predict the future vs it being totally impossible
    to do w/ any reasonable margin - just might be more efficient to use money
    so you don't have to do all that work)
- 56 - w/o foundational understanding, money reaches everything, orders
    everything
- 56 - orthodoxy: core problem is scarcity + provisioning, not about reducing
    uncertainty to quantifiable risk
- 60 - system can register irritations, doesn't have access to off-line self-
    repair function (much better / truer than previous argument)
- 60 - neolib strength: understand limit of rationalist approach, figure out how
    to steer politics which is now part of the economy (always had been tho)

## chapter 5: foucault beyond the critique of economism
- 61 - not just economy but also politics guided by order from uncertainty
- 61 - economy is central ordering mechanism of modern society
- 62 - agamben: sovereignty rooted in state's ability to make exceptions in
    crisis, order not slowly from knowledge but from logic of emergency + 
    exception
- 66 - riskless security is the impossible goal that drives this
- 67 - esposito: need to engage risk but also want immunity from risk
- 67 - "acute uncertainty tends to create its own kind of certainty - precisely
    not an ability to act on accurate knowledge of the future, but a definite
    certainty as to what needs to be done in the absence of such knowledge"
- 68 - in financial crisis, state invested in fundamentally unknown assets
    but widespread understanding it was necessary

## chapter 6: time, investment, and decision
- 73 - existence of double-entry bookkeeping only makes sense b/c we live in
    world w/o instantaneous adjustments (not neoclassical)
- 74 - only in world of uncertain investments do funds get tied up in ways that
    matter - need to generate enough revenue to keep up with debt repayment

## chapter 7: minsky beyond the critique of speculation
- 76 - minksy into balance sheets, liquidity becomes issue: might need to sell
    assets even if plan has good chance of working out over long term
- 76 - solvency: long term ability for balance sheets to work out, fundamental
    or timeless value (selling $10 bills for $5)
- 78 - banks leverage off of uncertainty by offering its commitments as a
    relatively safe asset, least uncertain; actors engage w/ bank b/c offers
    best chance of survival
- 78 - bank can borrow w/o a specific lender, its real lenders are people who
    accept its promises as currency
- 80 - leverage is procyclical, when things are good, get more credit -> more
    success -> more credit ...
- 80 - inability of one bank to pay obligations freezes other banks, etc, etc
- 81 - bank of england became lender of last resort, provided liquidity when
    others would not, prevented contagion
- 82 - central banking is not exogenous, just another form of banking that can
    safeguard system by selectively socializing risk
- 83 - central banking very efficient b/c organically connected to lower level,
    relies on existing connections; fortify nodes of payment system in crisis

## chapter 8: practices of (central) banking, imaginaries of neutrality
- 87 - modern time: distinguish between speculation "continuously making
    distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate fictions"
- 91 - minsky: solvency + asset values depend on liquidity (defined above), so
    selective liquidity from central bank isn't neutral, means some value
    perserved better than other -> moral + political suspicion
- 92 - 19th century: central banks only about last-resort lending; 20th century:
    banks only about interest rates + inflation

## chapter 9: lineages of us financial governance
- 94 - provision of liquidity insufficient in solvency crisis, underlying value
    doubted
- 95 - bank deposit insurance ended deleveraging motion, so now only leveraging
    -> permanent inflationary pressure
- 96 - attempts to limit bank credit creation only led to more shadow banking
- 97 - arthur burns: inflation psychological, bound up with expectations
- 98 - volcker was skeptical of monetarism as economic theory, but saw it as
    useful tool to change expectations, a rhetorical device
- 99 - monetarists argued against social engineering w/ financial policy

## chapter 10: hayek and neoliberal reason
- 101 - hayek thought centralized control was at root of econ problems of 70s
- 103 - common critique: capitalist problems b/c "still" externally distorted
    by politics; gains strength even when disproven b/c "evidence" that
    corruption goes deeper
- 104 - hayek not interested in entrepenuer, fixates on debtor in trouble
- 105 - hayek critiques critical impulse: "shut up and do your job" -> still
    at heart of neoliberalism
- 106 - hayek emphasized systemic complexity to argue that central planning by
    solving simultaneous equations impossible
- 107 - hayek in favor of denationalization of money, let market decide on money
    (this book seems to suggest we have done so already, the dollar is the
    biggest currency on the block)
- 107 - hayek wasn't a student of previous currencies i guess, modern role of
    the state was the outcome of the evolutionary process described

## chapter 11: neoliberal financial governance
- 109 - volcker rate hike was speculative, intuited ordering potential
- 110 - predictable that hike would cause shadow banking expansion; was wager
    that rate hike would cause social/political change
- 111 - fordist finance based on steady paychecks, neolib finance on precarity
- 111 - person under neolib thinks of self as speculative unit, under pressure
    to make decisions about self under uncertainty
- 112 - large financial institutions want to transform their risks into dangers
    of all others
- 113 - neolibs ok with after-the-fact bailouts, switched from prevention to
    containment
- 114 - fed engaged directly with payments system b/c liquidity -> solvency
- 115 - monetary management became rhetorical, inflation managed through
    interest rate target announcements
- 115 - neolibs: not that bubbles couldn't form, just that regulators were in no
    better position to spot them than anyone else
- 117 - beggs: "the bailout and not the crisis itself might be seen as the real
    'Minksy moment'" -> minsky saw redistribution of liquidity as endogenous
    to financial system
- 118 - imminent failure activates patterns of normalization, might be in the
    dark about why crisis hit, but we must protect the banks
- 120 - risk management exists strong now, but it's not signal of post-neolib
- 121 - too-big-to-fail treated as stabilization policy now, hence no prevention
    of firms getting so big
- 122 - critiques of austerity (destruction of value, short-termism) fail to
    understand popular support
- 123 - push for austerity co-opted by neolibs, driven by hayekian disdain for
    the debtor, the critic
- 125 - expanding student debt can be seen as punishment for being critic hayek
    criticizes, for seeking knowledge without submitting to the economy

## chapter 12: capital and critique in neoliberal times
- 127 - elite control more symptom than cause of neolib
- 127 - "we are currently seeing the bizarre emergence of an academic growth
    sector devoted to explaining the failure of social reality to conform itself
    to social scientists' fantasies ... - a curious imitation of the financial
    sector's own ability to profit from failure"
- 128 - state capture model plays into neolib reason, gives credibility to
    crisis-free market economy; imagined purification at heart of neolib project
- 129 - critique of speculation "appears more as a moral stance" than serious
    attempt to understand capitalism
- 130 - connolly: neoliberalism is doctrine "that fails to recognize or respect
    the limits of economic self-organization"
- 130 - latour: moderns have made things so well that they are "unhelpfully
    invested in the imagined purity of their constructions"
- 132 - critique is performance, to ask more of it confers upon it more
    responsibility than it can handle, (don't ask me what to do)

## critiques
- 7 - terrible sentence: "Plasticity refers to the constitutive character of
    contingent associations, the way one connection inflects the generation and
    patterning of new connections and thus adjusts the course of history,
    allowing for the emergence of determinate entities in a world that has no
    external mover."
- 14 - definitions of immanent and constitutive show up here after being used
    several times
- 39 - worst way to talk about self-fulfilling: "Here the notion of
    performativity has become closely allied with the theory of speech acts,
    which states that utterances can sometimes bring about their own truth
    conditions (as in "I hereby promise") and so highlights the constructive
    aspects of discourse and language."
- 51 - "The fact that our ability to perceive problems always exceeds the
    ability to diagnose them stems from the fact that we cannot easily
    separate ourselves from the problem" -> disagree, one question is inherently
    more difficult than the other, requires more information, more computation;
    keep coming back to analogy to airplane warning light in flight, many
    possible causes - is this the wrong way to think about it?
- 57 - history purely from european point of view, even then tenuous
- 58 - lol @ adam smith as one of the first to talk about money as barter, arab
    scholars talked about this hundred of years before, smith likely read them
- 65 - wrote in margin this was worst writing so far: "Key here is his
    differentiation of biopolitical normalization from the disciplinary norm:
    wheras the latter is associated with a transcendental understanding of
    power, the former involves a more pragmatic and relational understanding
    of normativity, seen as an endogenously generated point of reference that
    exerts organizing effects on the contingent processes from which it is born"
- 70 - again with this weird stuff about premodern time, again european only
- 71 - definition of chresmatics shows up 60 or so pages after first use
- 85 - again purely from a european perspective, should be stated explicitly
- 87 - "in premodern times any attempt to deal in futurity was suspect" - what
    are interest-bearing loans? are they not future-facing? and what about
    chinese buddhist monasteries with their perpetual endowments?
