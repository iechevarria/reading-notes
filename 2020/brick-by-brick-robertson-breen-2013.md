the following are my personal notes on brick by brick. they are not a summary of the book. instead, they're a collection of facts/ideas that caught my eye or that are new to me.

## preface
- ix - this book was originally just going to be about innovation with some examples, lego only one of them

## 1: stacking up
- 18 - mention hilary fisher page's plastic bricks
- 20 - brick with clutch power patented in 1958
- 22 - six principles godtfred came up with (several revisions):
    - limited in size without limiting imagination
    - affordable
    - simple, durable
    - for girls, boys, every age
    - classic without need for renewal
    - easy to distribute
- 23 - supplementary packs offered early on as impulse buys
- 25 - godtfred rejected more lego elements than he accepted
- 25 - original lego colors where from mondrian
- 29 - lego expanded retailers in 50s and 60s w/ in-store displays; recognized repeat sales up to kids, first sale up to retailer
- 31 - 70s: lego was nearly 1% denmark's industrial exports, but growth plateau
- 32 - scala was jewelry line for girls (tried again w/ clickits, dots)
- 33 - mid 70s didn't have minifig, so sets were out of scale

## 2: boosting innovation
- 40 - ole kirk: never let war seem like children's play
- 41 - 90s: half of all toys sold were licensed
- 41 - concered about star wars violence, polled parents to see attitudes
- 43 - 93: lego growth stalled out
- 43 - 94-98: lego tripled number of new toys produced, 5+ themes/yr
- 45 - 98: poul ploughmann, turnaround expert brought on for day-to-day
- 45 - first lego star wars revenue 5x forecast
- 48 - major design team expansion beyond denmark
- 49 - late 90s: real fear that electronic toys overtaking physical toys
- 49 - ploughmann actively tried to make brick less important "in the minds of mothers" (he talks about mothers a lot)
- 51 - lego actively going for kids who don't like building, hypothetically larger market
- 51 - ciccolella, head of marketing: lego brick "our biggest limitation"
- 51 - "lot of concern that children couldn't build anymore"
- 52 - jack stone made to apppeal to american boys
- 54 - lego darwin software project grew to 120 people
- 56 - lego digital designed allegedly based on darwin
- 57 - galidor came from effort to make building system without brick
- 58 - poached head of action figures from hasbro
- 59 - exec team incredibly enthusiastic about galidor, esp after tv show
- 60 - ploughmann wanted to open 300 lego stores (again talks about mothers)

## 3: losing control
- 63 - feb 03: large retailers had huge backlog, inventory up 40% at some
- 66 - very few product lines actually made money
- 67 - "highly dysfunctional" supply chain team according to knudstorp
- 67 - retailers saw lego as aloof, uncaring; designers didn't understand business implications of actions
- 67 - company couldn't forecast at all b/c was a loose holding company
- 69 - ovesen: "they didn't know where they made money"
- 70 - company didn't track which products made money
- 72 - ploughmann with the mothers again
- 72 - ciccolella got rid of duplo rabbit for explore
- 74 - ploughmann threated to fire execs if they didn't support explore
- 75 - zowie kidpad AR toy (like hidden side)
- 76 - ciccolella didn't talk about kidpad ever again after it was cancelled, "Let's move on. There's nothing to see here."
- 76 - consultants said brick was passe, "They said the twenty-first century is not about little square plastic blocks. It's digital."
- 76 - consultants said exploit brand, not bricks
- 77 - moviemaker had central camera kit but add-ons didn't sell well (will the same happen to lego mario?)
- 78 - shift to "darker and edgier" sets with good-versus-evik
- 79 - american market dominated by walmart, kmart, toys r us, target; exercised a lot of control
- 79 - jack stone pieces expensive b/c mold size + complexity, even in high volumes
- 80 - "[Managers] told us the building experience wasn't the main purpose any longer."
- 82 - darwin team chose wrong data model, all work eventually scrapped
- 83 - "there weren't any software experts in top management, or anyone with a deep knowledge of digital technology."
- 86 - galidor tv show stank, worst-selling theme of all time
- 87 - bionicle and galidor went out in parallel, bionicle totally cannibalized
- 87 - retailers uncomfortable with lego stores, lego argued it increased demand at toys r us (savvy and misleading imo)
- 91 - 03: "There was this feeling that LEGO wouldn't exist in another year."

## 4: building an innovation culture
- 97 - staff psyched to see ploughmann gone (called him mr. death)
- 98 - early 04: 94% of sets unprofitable
- 99 - ovesen talked to mattel about acquisition
- 102 - ovesen via knudstorp: "I have never seen so much shit in my life. Everything is broken. You're not making any money. You can't even forecast your sales, and people are so happy - I can't believe it"
- 103 - "forget [for now] about the visionary, child-development stuff"
- 105 - toys r us said they understood lego better than lego did
- 106 - lego had demand for bionicle but couldn't fulfill it
- 109 - ovesen set profit goal of 13.5% for any given product
- 111 - 04: knudstorp pushed to standardize elements
- 113 - 97-04: 6000 elements to 14200
- 114 - 90% of elements used just once
- 115 - in the 80s, designers had to abide by full manufacturing cost (fmc), but in the late 90s, fmc was discarded, designers made more new pieces, costs up
- 120 - 04: knudstorp appointed ceo, only one executive called to congratulate

## 5: becoming customer driven
- 124 - mads nipper joined in 1990, worked on in-store marketing in europe, made case for d2c business, lego.com
- 126 - 99: lego city was 1/8 revenue
- 129 - of people who joined in the late 90s / early 00s: "They didn't know who the core consumer was and they didn't understand the core business logic. It was very, very hard."
- 130 - late 90s: adults got back into lego b/c star wars and mindstorms (i also suspect demographics, people who grew up w/ lego's golden age hit prime earning years)
- 132 - internally, lego thought adult fans few and not worth listening to, discouraged direct contact with adult fans
- 132 - afol 5% of company's revenue, but each outspent families 20x
- 136 - research: lego kids normal w/ a little more tv + reading; lego kids also played videogames, not mutually exclusive
- 138 - narrowed customer profile: 5-9 yr old german boys who like construction toys
- 141 - overly beaurocratic process in lego: "Each step of the way, people had to fill out multiple forms and checklists."
- 143 - 04: lego city selling big again
- 150 - retailers increasing bargaining power

## 6: exploring the full spectrum of innovation
- 155 - 03: bionicle 25% of total sales
- 158 - targeted at kids who outgrew system sets, not ready for technic
- 159 - made to be sold through nontraditional lego retaielrs like gas stations and convenince stores
- 160 - priced and promoted to sell throughout year
- 163 - original bionicle names: axe, blade, flame, kick, hook, claw (oof lol)
- 168 - comic books came out in off-season months jan + aug
- 174 - bionicle was also cheaper, so filled demographic gap as well as seasonal gap

## 7: fostering open innovation
- 182 - people hacked mindstorms, lawyers thought it was a problem, engineers thought it was a good sign; added "right to hack" to software license and website
- 184 - mindstorms was best-selling product in company history (by what measure, until what year?)
- 189 - mindstorms had little marketing support
- 192 - lego got a lot of free labor when developing mindstorms v2 >:(
- 194 - dc power pack and more memory were apparently budget busters (???)
- 199 - nxt sold $30M in first year (seems kind of small); mindstorms + nxt sold 2M units total (again seems small?)
- 199 - lego didn't expand team to non-employees until all major design decisions locked in
- 202 - architecture came out of initiative to launch low-cost, low-risk experiments
- 204 - first architecture set has instructions w/ photos of tower, brief profile of architect, other details (still do this stuff - was this the first example though? think discovery channel-lego collab sets might have had the same thing)
- 205 - exec (smith-meyer) and adam reed tucker (fan/designer) hashed out plan over two days to make 1000 set run
- 205 - lego architecture was pitched for souvenir shops, museum shops, bookstore chains
- 206 - lego architecture premium ($20 / 70pcs vs usual $7) shocked the board, thought it was "crazy" (shows they thought of lego bricks as commodity, understandably)
- 207 - smith-meyer make initial packaging himself, tucker designed but also set up printer to make boxes, set up licensing deal w/ sears tower owners
- 207 - pieces showed up to tucker's door, he and his wife make sets by hand
- 208 - 8 weeks start to finish for poc, total cost to lego $10k (extremely dubious number imo, what about labor?)
- 210 - lego architecture "very, very profitable" according to smith-meyer (why does it cost more? b/c people will pay more)
- 210 - 60% of buyers over 18, 15% never purchased lego before (!!!)

## 8: attempting a disruptive innovation
- 217 - 05: company thought digital bricks could replace plastic, wanted to preempt
- 218 - 350 stakeholders, 5 years, 3 missed deadlines for lego universe
- 220 - mmo had potential to get huge in lego's eyes (they usually go bust, though, you're not going to make wow lol)
- 221 - chose team from 51 different mmo studios
- 222 - lego rfp was hundreds of pages, very few questions about game, indicated lego didn't know what it wanted
- 223 - lego demanded all bricks be accurate and detailed
- 224 - contract provision demanded game be free of bugs
- 226 - relied on volunteer labor again yikes
- 227 - lego execs flew out every 6 weeks, encouraged turd polishing while core rotted
- 230 - $40 purchase + $15/mo too much for kids game
- 231 - resubscription rate 87%, above industry standard
- 232 - no mention of infiniminer in minecraft origin
- 235 - talks about using minecraft and then 3d printing minecraft buildings - i think this misses the point. ergonomics of building with lego bricks irl is great, on a computer is very difficult and not exactly fun. largely b/c many many many element types and ways they can go together. minecraft worked b/c simplified to very few elements and allowed basically anything to connect to anything. you can build more interesting things in lego more quickly than minecraft + 3d printer

## 9: sailing for blue ocean
- 248 - anthropology consultants: "Social play, hierarchy, competition, mastery" things that kids like to do that were "unmet consumer needs" - fortnite taps into this very well; anecdotally i can say that i agree b/c videogames largely lack appeal for me b/c i get this kind of stuff at work (where i am also paid btw)
- 248 - concept lab enlisted a stakeholder group of senior executives (lol is this power base selling? making sure they're bought in immediately? definitely looks like internal selling, which is good btw)
- 249 - use posters to pitch new ideas, so concept is developed, not presentation
- 249 - again with the five- to nine-year-old boy
- 251 - somebody floated lego water guns
- 253 - again with mothers! mothers purchase board games, so do board games (btw, what's TAM for board games? was this actually a good play?)
- 257 - board game market heavily skewed toward christmas
- 259 - lego got 13-45% of board game markets where it competed (!!!)
- 260 - sales cooled in 2011-2012, declined afterward

## 10: leveraging diverse and creative people
- 265 - lego launches big bet line once a year (apparently atlantis was one)
- 268 - t-shaped people: broad knowledge + small exceptional expertise, a mckinsey thing
- 273 - high conflict, fantasy predicted to bring success
- 273 - lego city used to be low-conflict, realistic (imo now high conflict, fantasy also w/ lines like swamp police and sky police ugh)
- 276 - ninjago unstated goal: get so popular it's banned from schools
- 278 - "testing was not only a creative tool, it was a persuading tool."
- 278 - selecting lego lines is largely thinning of herd, very selective

## 11: transforming lego
- 286 - lego life of george: another ar precursor?
- 288 - seems like lego universe may have been bad fit, they wanted to go darker which isn't really appropriate for lego

## charts
- 36 - revenue chart 1960-1993
- 44 - revenue / new sets / profit chart 1994-1998
- 148 - great timeline plotting 04-09 plan
- 176 - lego innovation matrix, stinks imo, one axis is continuous, other doesn't make spatial sense

## critiques
- 61 - inscrutable product structure
- 62 - some liberties with timeline
- 134 - lego micro city called great but actually not fondly remembered
- 186 - extreme liberties with timeline of "wisdom of the crowd"
- 188 - nit: mindstorms doesn't so much stand out from mp3 players as it fits in
- 190 - technic has "greater flexibility" than system - very loaded imo, ultra debatable
- 230 - floats idea that if lego let the game get dark enough, might have expanded to new audiences (i think it would have done the brand harm)
- generally - wish there was a section on lego friends or really anything marketed to girls

## things to look up
- 48 - zowie intertainment, san mateo ca
