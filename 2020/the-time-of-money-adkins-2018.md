the following are my notes on the time of money. this is not a summary. instead,
these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye.

## chapter 1: money on the move
- 26 - workers in a state of constant expectation; people say that the future
    has closed down bc capital needs workers in never-ending present
- 30 - esposito: people sell their futures for their present; this
    de-futurization shouldn't be allowed
- 35 - bourdieu: economic agents not rational calculators, instead driven by
    habitus, unconscious structures
- 35 - bourdieu: anticipation is natural part of action, so to say society is
    unnaturally forward-looking seems weird
- 40 - bourdieu: events/practices take place in time but also make time ... lol.
    calhoun + beasley-murray say this throws his account of time "into radical
    doubt" bc just look at clock dummy

## chapter 2: austere times
- 51 - austerity pushed by institutions for competitiveness by dpressing wages,
    removing employment protection, creating unpaid/low-paid jobs
- 52 - austeriry not about finance - it helps financial-asset rich
- 53 - austerity is free insurance for top end of wealth spectrum; is a class
    project; blyth: class-specific put option
- 58 - money viewed as justice-giving substance; assumes 1) money measures and
    2) can mediate between things to create equivalence (??? yes)
- 66 - households more and more dependent on wages of women despite precarity
- 67 - farris: poor women do domestic services so privileged women can do their
    own wage labor
- 69 - unlike fordist era, all adults today have a duty to work; income from
    state are now more conditional and precarious
- 69 - new set of ideals for women: "These include employment, wage earning,
    excessive attachments to waged work, intensive motherhood, and a
    rearticulated domestic femininity defined in terms of heterosexual intimacy
    and an entrepeneurial, investor attitude toward the domestic space and the
    work of social reproduction" (sounds like mommy blogs)
- 70 - fordism had obligations to family, now family needs self-sufficiency
- 70 - post-fordism has unique suffering for women: "These include constant and
    exhausting labor, as well as specific feeling states such as guilt and shame
    and the fatigue of constantly deferred hope."
- 77 - "To put it straightforwardly, the cuts to state provisioning and further
    cuts to (already repressed) wages that austerity entails provoke households
    to further enroll in the economy of debt by speculating on their repressed
    incomes"

## chapter 3: the speculative time of debt
- 90 - securitization enables more flexibility on payment - creditor objective
    shifts from repayment to payment - loans are now granted on ability to
    service rather than repay debt
- 92 - securitized mortgages allow lending based on future potential incomes
    instead of current; allow borrowing from the future to the present with the
    caveat that the future need not exist
- 97 - "Speculative time is a time in which pasts, presents, and futures stand
    not in a predetermined or pre-set relation to each other but are in a
    continuous state
- 98 - securitized debt is special bc the option of nonpayment / delayed payment
    gives more opportunities to expand surplus
- 100 - "social and financial attributions do not map onto each other in any
    straightforward fashion" -> maybe a little though? think konings would say
    perhaps yes?

## chapter 4: wages and the problem of value
- 109 - harvey: wage stagnation from change in social contact (wage), attack on
    labor, consolidation of capital's power; power went from labor to capital
- 114 - workers become indebted to make up for lost wages -> become entangled
    in financial markets + risk (how does the risk get to them though? ARMs?)
- 119 - search for foundations of value of labor is still part of the dynamic of
    finance-led post-fordism; might actually be more threatening to labor (not
    convincing imo; i wouldnt do it, but this didnt convince me not to)
- 126 - attempts to re-anchor wages to value problematic bc involves search for
    fundamental value (!! good point that i am sympathetic to !!)
- 128 - instead of arguing over wages, why not think about desired end state:
    access to money. does it really have to be through wages reflecting value?
    "Instead of endeavoring to undermine the ideal of the asset-owning and
    interest-earning investor worker-subject through attempts to reinstate the
    fiction of the commodity-owning free laborer, why not embrace this ideal and
    develop an ambitious set of goals for this worker-subject" finally specific
    here! hooray!! and good point!

## chapter 5: out of work
- 133 - activation regimes are like creation of surplus with flows of money
- 142 - reports after the recession said women were at risk of losing progress;
    this is dumb b/c we can't go back in time; rests on the assumption that "if
    women leave work, they will necessarily be carers, wives, and mothers" -
    only two states for women, at work or in the home - no such thing as women
    just being unemployed (used to be the case in fordism but no longer)
- 146 - welfare state changed into a thing that requires activity; these changes
    occurred in many nations
- 147 - focus moved from demand to supply of labor, unemployment reframed as
    issue of competitiveness
- 149 - activation schemes are labor-supply mechanism for bottommost rungs of
    labor markets, undercuts the price of labor
- 153 - activation regimes add opportunities to shoulder credit debt
- 156 - activation makes unemployment antithetical to uselessness/inactivity -
    it's highly active and work-full
- 160 - not just employed who operate via logic of speculation, also unemployed

## conclusion
- 169 - "The idea that money, debt, and finance are immaterial fails, then, to
    recognize that their very operations are at the heart of the organization of
    social life - indeed, fails to recognize the operation of speculation as a
    rationality"
- 170 - value as measure of labor: "was the outcome of specific institutional
    arrangements - and moreover , it was the case only for certain sectors of
    the workforcce, in particular male workers"
- 173 - to reduce finance to debt and debt to neoliberal governance misses the
    rewriting of social

## general comments
- 33 - this guy bourdieu seems like he's full of crap. he insists that "the
    future is always inscribed in the immediate present" bc agents anticipate
    future. what about chaos? to say nothing of randomness
- 34 - economic field creates predictable / calculable future - ???
- 35 - bourdieu: future inscribed in present, so can you really sell/ruin your
    future? yeah duh of course doofus. look at a chess game. some moves will
    allow you to make more moves down the line, others will restrict number of
    future options. definitely possible ya doofus!
- 40 - really don't need a framework as radical as bourdieu's to argue that
    actions are inherently anticiparticipatory. take word2vec - trains on
    prediciton task. i can feel anticipation in conversation, i feel myself
    predicting the next word someone will say. take indigenous people's
    controlled burns - clearly a forward-looking action. don't need his weird
    dumb crap to see!!
- 48 - need more examples of how finance becomes time, money becomes time. Don't
    get it - futures dealth with immediately? examples would help
- 122 - lots of emphasis on money losing its measurement function. I don't see
    it! need more examples maybe or maybe I just can't be convinced. Not great
    that so much of the book relies on this assertion!
- 174 - whole book would have been better with more specific examples
- 184 - income volatility example is great, and the actual text would have
    benefited if this was in there. would have been great to have something so
    concrete while reading
