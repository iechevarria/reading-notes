# brick by brick: how lego rewrote the rules of innovation and conquered the global toy industry (2013)

the following are my personal notes on brick by brick. they are not a summary of
the book. instead, they're a collection of facts/ideas that caught my eye or
that are new to me.

## preface
- ix - this book was originally just going to be about innovation with some
    examples, lego only one of them

## 1: stacking up
- 18 - mention hilary fisher page's plastic bricks
- 20 - brick with clutch power patented in 1958
- 22 - six principles godtfred came up with (several revisions):
    - limited in size without limiting imagination
    - affordable
    - simple, durable
    - for girls, boys, every age
    - classic without need for renewal
    - easy to distribute
- 23 - supplementary packs offered early on as impulse buys
- 25 - godtfred rejected more lego elements than he accepted
- 25 - original lego colors where from mondrian
- 29 - lego expanded retailers in 50s and 60s w/ in-store displays; recognized
    repeat sales up to kids, first sale up to retailer
- 31 - 70s: lego was nearly 1% denmark's industrial exports, but growth plateau
- 32 - scala was jewelry line for girls (tried again w/ clickits, dots)
- 33 - mid 70s didn't have minifig, so sets were out of scale

## 2: boosting innovation

- 45 - first lego star wars revenue 5x forecast
- 48 - major design team expansion beyond denmark
- 49 - late 90s: real fear that electronic toys overtaking physical toys
- 49 - ploughmann actively tried to make brick less important "in the minds of
    mothers" (he talks about mothers a lot)
- 51 - lego actively going for kids who don't like building, hypothetically
    larger market
- 51 - ciccolella, head of marketing: lego brick "our biggest limitation"
- 51 - "lot of concern that children couldn't build anymore"
- 52 - jack stone made to apppeal to american boys
- 54 - lego darwin software project grew to 120 people
- 56 - lego digital designed allegedly based on darwin
- 57 - galidor came from effort to make building system without brick
- 58 - poached head of action figures from hasbro
- 59 - exec team incredibly enthusiastic about galidor, esp after tv show
- 60 - ploughmann wanted to open 300 lego stores (again talks about mothers)

## 3: losing control
- 63 - feb 03: large retailers had huge backlog, inventory up 40% at some
- 66 - very few product lines actually made money
- 67 - "highly dysfunctional" supply chain team according to knudstorp
- 67 - retailers saw lego as aloof, uncaring; designers didn't understand
    business implications of actions
- 67 - company couldn't forecast at all b/c was a loose holding company
- 69 - ovesen: "they didn't know where they made money"
- 70 - company didn't track which products made money
- 72 - ploughmann with the mothers again
- 72 - ciccolella got rid of duplo rabbit for explore
- 74 - ploughmann threated to fire execs if they didn't support explore
- 75 - zowie kidpad AR toy (like hidden side)
- 76 - ciccolella didn't talk about kidpad ever again after it was cancelled,
    "Let's move on. There's nothing to see here."
- 76 - consultants said brick was passe, "They said the twenty-first century is
    not about little square plastic blocks. It's digital."
- 76 - consultants said exploit brand, not bricks
- 77 - moviemaker had central camera kit but add-ons didn't sell well (will the
    same happen to lego mario?)
- 78 - shift to "darker and edgier" sets with good-versus-evik
- 79 - american market dominated by walmart, kmart, toys r us, target; exercised
    a lot of control
- 79 - jack stone pieces expensive b/c mold size + complexity, even in high
    volumes
- 80 - "[Managers] told us the building experience wasn't the main purpose any
    longer."
- 82 - darwin team chose wrong data model, all work eventually scrapped
- 83 - "there weren't any software experts in top management, or anyone with a
    deep knowledge of digital technology."
- 86 - galidor tv show stank, worst-selling theme of all time
- 87 - bionicle and galidor went out in parallel, bionicle totally cannibalized
- 87 - retailers uncomfortable with lego stores, lego argued it increased
    demand at toys r us (savvy and misleading imo)
- 91 - 03: "There was this feeling that LEGO wouldn't exist in another year."

## 4: building an innovation culture

- 102 - ovesen via knudstorp: "I have never seen so much shit in my life.
    Everything is broken. You're not making any money. You can't even forecast
    your sales, and people are so happy - I can't believe it"
- 103 - "forget [for now] about the visionary, child-development stuff"
