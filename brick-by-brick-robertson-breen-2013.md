# brick by brick: how lego rewrote the rules of innovation and conquered the global toy industry (2013)

the following are my personal notes on brick by brick. they are not a summary of
the book. instead, they're a collection of facts/ideas that caught my eye or
that are new to me.

## preface
- ix - this book was originally just going to be about innovation with some
    examples, lego only one of them

## 1: stacking up
- 18 - mention hilary fisher page's plastic bricks
- 20 - brick with clutch power patented in 1958
- 22 - six principles godtfred came up with (several revisions):
    - limited in size without limiting imagination
    - affordable
    - simple, durable
    - for girls, boys, every age
    - classic without need for renewal
    - easy to distribute
- 23 - supplementary packs offered early on as impulse buys
- 25 - godtfred rejected more lego elements than he accepted
- 25 - original lego colors where from mondrian
- 29 - lego expanded retailers in 50s and 60s w/ in-store displays; recognized
    repeat sales up to kids, first sale up to retailer
- 31 - 70s: lego was nearly 1% denmark's industrial exports, but growth plateau
- 32 - scala was jewelry line for girls (tried again w/ clickits, dots)
- 33 - mid 70s didn't have minifig, so sets were out of scale

## 2: boosting innovation
- 40 - ole kirk: never let war seem like children's play
- 41 - 90s: half of all toys sold were licensed
- 41 - concered about star wars violence, polled parents to see attitudes
- 43 - 93: lego growth stalled out

- 45 - first lego star wars revenue 5x forecast
- 48 - major design team expansion beyond denmark
- 49 - late 90s: real fear that electronic toys overtaking physical toys
- 49 - ploughmann actively tried to make brick less important "in the minds of
    mothers" (he talks about mothers a lot)
- 51 - lego actively going for kids who don't like building, hypothetically
    larger market
- 51 - ciccolella, head of marketing: lego brick "our biggest limitation"
- 51 - "lot of concern that children couldn't build anymore"
- 52 - jack stone made to apppeal to american boys
- 54 - lego darwin software project grew to 120 people
- 56 - lego digital designed allegedly based on darwin
- 57 - galidor came from effort to make building system without brick
- 58 - poached head of action figures from hasbro
- 59 - exec team incredibly enthusiastic about galidor, esp after tv show
- 60 - ploughmann wanted to open 300 lego stores (again talks about mothers)

## 3: losing control
- 63 - feb 03: large retailers had huge backlog, inventory up 40% at some
- 66 - very few product lines actually made money
- 67 - "highly dysfunctional" supply chain team according to knudstorp
- 67 - retailers saw lego as aloof, uncaring; designers didn't understand
    business implications of actions
- 67 - company couldn't forecast at all b/c was a loose holding company
- 69 - ovesen: "they didn't know where they made money"
- 70 - company didn't track which products made money
- 72 - ploughmann with the mothers again
- 72 - ciccolella got rid of duplo rabbit for explore
- 74 - ploughmann threated to fire execs if they didn't support explore
- 75 - zowie kidpad AR toy (like hidden side)
- 76 - ciccolella didn't talk about kidpad ever again after it was cancelled,
    "Let's move on. There's nothing to see here."
- 76 - consultants said brick was passe, "They said the twenty-first century is
    not about little square plastic blocks. It's digital."
- 76 - consultants said exploit brand, not bricks
- 77 - moviemaker had central camera kit but add-ons didn't sell well (will the
    same happen to lego mario?)
- 78 - shift to "darker and edgier" sets with good-versus-evik
- 79 - american market dominated by walmart, kmart, toys r us, target; exercised
    a lot of control
- 79 - jack stone pieces expensive b/c mold size + complexity, even in high
    volumes
- 80 - "[Managers] told us the building experience wasn't the main purpose any
    longer."
- 82 - darwin team chose wrong data model, all work eventually scrapped
- 83 - "there weren't any software experts in top management, or anyone with a
    deep knowledge of digital technology."
- 86 - galidor tv show stank, worst-selling theme of all time
- 87 - bionicle and galidor went out in parallel, bionicle totally cannibalized
- 87 - retailers uncomfortable with lego stores, lego argued it increased
    demand at toys r us (savvy and misleading imo)
- 91 - 03: "There was this feeling that LEGO wouldn't exist in another year."

## 4: building an innovation culture
- 97 - staff psyched to see ploughmann gone (called him mr. death)
- 98 - early 04: 94% of sets unprofitable
- 99 - ovesen talked to mattel about acquisition
- 102 - ovesen via knudstorp: "I have never seen so much shit in my life.
    Everything is broken. You're not making any money. You can't even forecast
    your sales, and people are so happy - I can't believe it"
- 103 - "forget [for now] about the visionary, child-development stuff"
- 105 - toys r us said they understood lego better than lego did
- 106 - lego had demand for bionicle but couldn't fulfill it
- 109 - ovesen set profit goal of 13.5% for any given product
- 111 - 04: knudstorp pushed to standardize elements
- 113 - 97-04: 6000 elements to 14200
- 114 - 90% of elements used just once
- 115 - in the 80s, designers had to abide by full manufacturing cost (fmc), but
    in the late 90s, fmc was discarded, designers made more new pieces, costs up
- 120 - 04: knudstorp appointed ceo, only one executive called to congratulate

## 5: becoming customer driven
- 124 - mads nipper joined in 1990, worked on in-store marketing in europe, made
    case for d2c business, lego.com
- 126 - 99: lego city was 1/8 revenue
- 129 - of people who joined in the late 90s / early 00s: "They didn't know who
    the core consumer was and they didn't understand the core business logic. It
    was very, very hard."
- 130 - late 90s: adults got back into lego b/c star wars and mindstorms (i also
    suspect demographics, people who grew up w/ lego's golden age hit prime
    earning years)
- 132 - internally, lego thought adult fans few and not worth listening to,
    discouraged direct contact with adult fans
- 132 - afol 5% of company's revenue, but each outspent families 20x
- 136 - research: lego kids normal w/ a little more tv + reading; lego kids also
    played videogames, not mutually exclusive
- 138 - narrowed customer profile: 5-9 yr old german boys who like construction
    toys
- 141 - overly beaurocratic process in lego: "Each step of the way, people had
    to fill out multiple forms and checklists."
- 143 - 04: lego city selling big again
- 150 - retailers increasing bargaining power

## 6: exploring the full spectrum of innovation
- 155 - 03: bionicle 25% of total sales
- 158 - targeted at kids who outgrew system sets, not ready for technic
- 159 - made to be sold through nontraditional lego retaielrs like gas stations
    and convenince stores
- 160 - priced and promoted to sell throughout year
- 163 - original bionicle names: axe, blade, flame, kick, hook, claw (oof lol)
- 168 - comic books came out in off-season months jan + aug
- 174 - bionicle was also cheaper, so filled demographic gap as well as seasonal
    gap


## charts
- 36 - revenue chart 1960-1993
- 44 - revenue / new sets / profit chart 1994-1998

    doesn't make spatial sense
