# debt: the first 5,000 years by david graeber (2011)

the following are my personal notes on debt. they are not a summary of
the book. instead, they're a collection of ideas that caught my eye or that
are new to me.

## chapter one: on the experience of moral confusion

- 3 - IMF guaranteed loan enforcement, banks made loans to crooks in power
- 6 - not sure about the section about how US govt debt being held by other
    countries is effectively tribute. pretty sure they hold US debt b/c they use
    a lot of US dollars and want to earn interest

## chatper two: the myth of barter

- 21 - difference between debt and obligation is that debt can be precisely
    quantified. this requires money.
- 22 - myth of barter persists b/c credit arrangements not in archaelogical
    record while coins are
- 26 - many different fictional accounts of how money came from barter
- 28 - econs say humans have natural propensity to "truck and barter" and money
    is the most efficient means
- 29 - caroline humprey, anthropologist: no barter economy ever described, nor
    money's emergence from one, all evidence suggests never existed
- 32 - all cases of trade through barter are meetings with strangers they will
    never meet again (in non-industry)
- 36 - "double coincidence of wants" doesn't exist when people have ongoing
    relations
- 37 - "reverted to barter" doesn't happen, just move to credit systems actually
    still based on the old imperial currency despite absence of coin
- 38 - 3500 BC mesopotamia tablets with credit records
- 39 - sumerian money was not a product of commercial transactions but created
    by beaurocrats to keep track of resources, move between departments (reminds
    me of the veb thread on money as unit of administration)
- 40 - standard econ history (barter -> money -> credit) is precisely backwards,
    actually credit -> money -> barter

## chapter three: primordial debts

- 46 - credit theorists assert that money is not a commodity but instead unit of
    measurement
- 49 - money and markets do not appear spontaneously - govt use money to create
    markets
- 50 - concrete example: give soliders coin, require subjects give king coin ->
    no longer need to figure out how to move food to soldiers, let market do
    work.
- 50 - states create markets - stateless societies tend to be without markets
- 51 - malagasy people understood + resisted french colonizer effort to create
    markets: would pay taxes, give all excess to elders for sacrifices
- 52 - money is not a thing, just a way of comparing things mathematically
- 54 - keynes got into mesopotamia big time, concluded money is chartalist
- 65 - sumerian + babylonian kings regularly declared debt amnesties to head off
    social unrest + mass debt peonage
- 71 - states created markets, markets require states, neither could continue in
    their current forms without one another

## chapter four: cruelty and redemption

- 75 - coins, already valuable material, when stamped with authority, become
    more valuable than materials b/c it's a token of debt of greater value
- 79 - direct quote: "Up in our country we are human!" said the hunter. "And 
    since we are human we help each other. We don't like to hear anybody say
    thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that
    by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs."
- 79 - instead of seeing himself as human b/c he could make calculations, he
    insists being truley human means refusing to make calculations. he is aware
    of propensity to calculate, that's why he said what he did.
- 82 - ceremonial acts of destroying tablet when cancelling debt, was repeated
    in many peasant revolutions
- 86 - debt was more popular cause than abolition for two main reasons: 1) debt
    hurt free peasantry, base of military power 2) slavery implies intrinsic
    inferiority, debt still has prospect of equality

## chapter five: a brief treastise on the moral grounds of economic relations

- 90 - econ assumptions about human behavior (self-interested, calculating, 
    optimizing) refuted by psych
- 91 - humans more motivated by justice and "reciprocity"
- 94 - communism according to graeber: "from each according to their abilities,
    to each according to their needs"
- 95 - all of us act like communists some of the time, none of us all the time.
    society organized around communism exclusively could never work, all systems
    rely on communism, including capitalism
- 96 - when worker says "hand me the wrench," the other does instead of saying
    "what do i get for it?" b/c simple efficiency
- 96 - "communism is the foundation of all human sociability"
- 96 - evidenced by the surprise at exceptions: evans-pritchard was with nuer
    people and asked directions, and they sent him the wrong way. he was shocked
    to be misled
- 100 - baseline communism is not reciprocity. it's about knowing the other
    would do the same, not that they will. relation is based on presumption of
    eternity
- 102 - all transactions are to some degree moral b/c communism is morality
- 103 - what marks exchange is that it's impersonal, that who is buying or
    selling should be irrelevant
- 104 - exchange allows us to cancel out our debts, to end a relationship
- 105 - tiv women are careful to give gifts to each other that vary slightly in
    value to preserve the relationship
- 108 - within communities, reluctance to allow things to cancel out, so when
    money is in common usage, people often refuse to use it with friends or
    relatives, or instead use it radically different ways (like malagasy)
- 109 - hierarchy has implies explicit superiority, operated by logic of
    precedent instead of reciprocal terms
- 110 - one-sided generosity is treated as precedent w/ charities
- 113 - egalitarian socities use authority to redistribute vs using authority
    to accumulate riches
- 114 - markets aren't real, they assume everyone is engaged in the same self-
    interested calculating exchanges
- 116 - gift to inuit walrus hunter isn't something given freely. the thank
    suggests that they would not have acted this way, creates state of debt and
    therefore inferiority. inuit people actively warded off hierarchy for
    thousands of years
- 120 - debt requires people who are at least potential equals and who are not
    currently in a state of equality but for whom there is a way to get back
- 122 -"All human interactions are not forms of exchange. Only some are.
    Exchange implies equality, but it also implies separation. It's precisely
    when money changes hands, when the debt is canceled, that equality is
    restored _and_ both parties can walk away and have nothing further to do
    with each other."
- 122 - debt is what happens in between, when they haven't walked away from one
    another b/c they're not equal. achieving equality destroys relationship
- 122 - tiv women created society with perpetual small debts to one another
