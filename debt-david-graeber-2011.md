# debt: the first 5,000 years by david graeber (2011)

the following are my personal notes on debt. they are not a summary of
the book. instead, they're a collection of ideas that caught my eye or that
are new to me.

## chapter one: on the experience of moral confusion

- 3 - IMF guaranteed loan enforcement, banks made loans to crooks in power
- 6 - not sure about the section about how US govt debt being held by other
    countries is effectively tribute. pretty sure they hold US debt b/c they use
    a lot of US dollars and want to earn interest

## chatper two: the myth of barter

- 21 - difference between debt and obligation is that debt can be precisely
    quantified. this requires money.
- 22 - myth of barter persists b/c credit arrangements not in archaelogical
    record while coins are
- 26 - many different fictional accounts of how money came from barter
- 28 - econs say humans have natural propensity to "truck and barter" and money
    is the most efficient means
- 29 - caroline humprey, anthropologist: no barter economy ever described, nor
    money's emergence from one, all evidence suggests never existed
- 32 - all cases of trade through barter are meetings with strangers they will
    never meet again (in non-industry)
- 36 - "double coincidence of wants" doesn't exist when people have ongoing
    relations
- 37 - "reverted to barter" doesn't happen, just move to credit systems actually
    still based on the old imperial currency despite absence of coin
- 38 - 3500 BC mesopotamia tablets with credit records
- 39 - sumerian money was not a product of commercial transactions but created
    by beaurocrats to keep track of resources, move between departments (reminds
    me of the veb thread on money as unit of administration)
- 40 - standard econ history (barter -> money -> credit) is precisely backwards,
    actually credit -> money -> barter

## chapter three: primordial debts

- 46 - credit theorists assert that money is not a commodity but instead unit of
    measurement
- 49 - money and markets do not appear spontaneously - govt use money to create
    markets
- 50 - concrete example: give soliders coin, require subjects give king coin ->
    no longer need to figure out how to move food to soldiers, let market do
    work.
- 50 - states create markets - stateless societies tend to be without markets
- 51 - malagasy people understood + resisted french colonizer effort to create
    markets: would pay taxes, give all excess to elders for sacrifices
- 52 - money is not a thing, just a way of comparing things mathematically
- 54 - keynes got into mesopotamia big time, concluded money is chartalist
- 65 - sumerian + babylonian kings regularly declared debt amnesties to head off
    social unrest + mass debt peonage
- 71 - states created markets, markets require states, neither could continue in
    their current forms without one another

## chapter four: cruelty and redemption

- 75 - coins, already valuable material, when stamped with authority, become
    more valuable than materials b/c it's a token of debt of greater value
- 79 - direct quote: "Up in our country we are human!" said the hunter. "And 
    since we are human we help each other. We don't like to hear anybody say
    thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that
    by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs."
- 79 - instead of seeing himself as human b/c he could make calculations, he
    insists being truley human means refusing to make calculations. he is aware
    of propensity to calculate, that's why he said what he did.
- 82 - ceremonial acts of destroying tablet when cancelling debt, was repeated
    in many peasant revolutions
- 86 - debt was more popular cause than abolition for two main reasons: 1) debt
    hurt free peasantry, base of military power 2) slavery implies intrinsic
    inferiority, debt still has prospect of equality

## chapter five: a brief treastise on the moral grounds of economic relations

- 90 - econ assumptions about human behavior (self-interested, calculating, 
    optimizing) refuted by psych
- 91 - humans more motivated by justice and "reciprocity"
- 94 - communism according to graeber: "from each according to their abilities,
    to each according to their needs"
- 95 - all of us act like communists some of the time, none of us all the time.
    society organized around communism exclusively could never work, all systems
    rely on communism, including capitalism
- 96 - when worker says "hand me the wrench," the other does instead of saying
    "what do i get for it?" b/c simple efficiency
- 96 - "communism is the foundation of all human sociability"
- 96 - evidenced by the surprise at exceptions: evans-pritchard was with nuer
    people and asked directions, and they sent him the wrong way. he was shocked
    to be misled
- 100 - baseline communism is not reciprocity. it's about knowing the other
    would do the same, not that they will. relation is based on presumption of
    eternity
- 102 - all transactions are to some degree moral b/c communism is morality
- 103 - what marks exchange is that it's impersonal, that who is buying or
    selling should be irrelevant
- 104 - exchange allows us to cancel out our debts, to end a relationship
- 105 - tiv women are careful to give gifts to each other that vary slightly in
    value to preserve the relationship
- 108 - within communities, reluctance to allow things to cancel out, so when
    money is in common usage, people often refuse to use it with friends or
    relatives, or instead use it radically different ways (like malagasy)
- 109 - hierarchy has implies explicit superiority, operated by logic of
    precedent instead of reciprocal terms
- 110 - one-sided generosity is treated as precedent w/ charities
- 113 - egalitarian socities use authority to redistribute vs using authority
    to accumulate riches
- 114 - markets aren't real, they assume everyone is engaged in the same self-
    interested calculating exchanges
- 116 - gift to inuit walrus hunter isn't something given freely. the thank
    suggests that they would not have acted this way, creates state of debt and
    therefore inferiority. inuit people actively warded off hierarchy for
    thousands of years
- 120 - debt requires people who are at least potential equals and who are not
    currently in a state of equality but for whom there is a way to get back
- 122 -"All human interactions are not forms of exchange. Only some are.
    Exchange implies equality, but it also implies separation. It's precisely
    when money changes hands, when the debt is canceled, that equality is
    restored _and_ both parties can walk away and have nothing further to do
    with each other."
- 122 - debt is what happens in between, when they haven't walked away from one
    another b/c they're not equal. achieving equality destroys relationship
- 122 - tiv women created society with perpetual small debts to one another

## chapter six: games with sex and death

- 128 - economic conception of barter is utopian w/ no place for sadism
- 129 - commandment to not covet they neighbor's wife isn't about adultery (
    there's already one for that) - it's about making your neighbor's wife a
    debt-peon
- 136 - in human econmies, money is first and foremost the acknowledgement of
    the existence of debt that cannot be repaid (e.g. a murdered family member)
- 144 - only when violence enters is human life directly comparable to money.
    force cuts through real human relationships and the logic that only human
    lives can be exchanged for other human lives and never physical objects
- 146 - general principle: to make something saleable in a human economy, one
    needs to rip it from context. slaves are people stolen from community
- 152 - pervasive violence made slave trade possible
- 159 - to make one person equivalent in the context of exchange to another
    requires an amount of violence to rip them from context, and to make them
    equivalent to an object requires more violence
- 160 - role of violence is explicit in our society
- 163 - interesting question: to what degree does the process of dislodging
    people from context to make them subject to debt constitute civlization?
    slavery is the natural endpoint

## chapter seven: honor and degradation

- 167 - roman law students were taught slavery is contrary to nature
- 168 - slavery is the ultimate form of being ripped from one's context, a slave
    is effectively dead
- 169 - al-wahid says that one becomes a slave when they otherwise would have
    died
- 173 - irish law said that attacking a peasant under a lord's protection was
    like attacking man's wife or daughter, a violation of honor not of victim,
    but of the man who should have protected them
- 174 - irish law codes were extremely detailed and some come off like jokes
    "if stung by someone's bee, calculate cost of injury minus damage to bee if
    it was swatted"
- 178 - women everywhere in earliest sumerian texts, were leaders + elites, but
    over next thousand years they disappear
- 179 - some scholars say it's b/c state got more militaristic
- 179 - bridewealth happens when politics are about controlling labor. when land
    is at a premium, dowry is common
- 180 - mesopotamian creditworthiness was precisely equivalent control over
    household b/c family members were assets that could be bought/sold
- 185 - state played dual role in fostering commoditization and intervening to
    reduce bad effects in ways like periodic amnesties
- 187 - greeks elevated gifts, generosity, honor above commercial exchange
- 188 - greek people impulse to ban aristocratic culture but also imitate it
- 190 - money democratized desire, people wanted it and eventually needed it
- 191 - debt implies equality, that equality makes it even more difficult to
    endure
- 192 - neighbors gave, lent, borrowed but frustration happened and was made
    worse by ability to quantify amount being given
- 195 - everyday market transactions were typically done through credit, cash
    allowed pirates + kidnappers to do business b/c anonymity
- 199 - only absolute right in ownership is to prevent another from using
- 201 - rome initially was continual struggle between debtor/creditors, roman
    elite eventually realized free peasantry meant good army

## chapter eight: credit versus bullion

- 211 - slavery has been eliminated many times in history; in europe, it largely
    vanished after fall of rome
- 212 - modern racism invented largely b/c europeans didn't accept elite
    arguments that anyone could be justifiably enslaved (sounds like deliberate
    parellel to economists today)
- 212 - coinage appears several places roughly simultaneously, each with
    different physical form of coins. was social, not technological
- 213 - coinage disappeared after 600 ad, movement back to credit
- 213 - bullion common in violent times b/c gold + silver are possible to steal
    while debt is not
- 214 - in history, debt crises most damaging when money is most easily
    convertible to cash (liquidity a social ill?)
- 214 - mesopotamian money was largely accounting measure
- 215 - debt w/ interest happened in mesopotamia b/c temple beaurocrats didn't
    know the trade. merchants would typically share profit instead
- 218 - ancient egypt taxed, disbursed a lot and money was means of account
- 220 - notched wood as credit instruments long predated writing

## chapter nine: the axial age
- 225 - in china and india, coinage invented by private citizens then
    monopolized by state
- 226 - precious metal previously was largely in temples and houses of rich but
    made its way to people -> probably a result of plunder
- 227 - markets are convenient for governments b/c provisioning large armies
    and having monopoly on coinage by only accepting their own coins
- 229 - state require to be paid in its currency -> causes adoption + markets
- 230 - roman coinage appears almost exactly when debt bondage outlawed, was
    used to solve debt crisis
- 231 - areas w/o mines or military, older credit systems stayed intact
- 233 - in india, market economy taken over by govt, used profit to get money
    back
- 235 - buddhism chill w/ usury, was open to commerce
- 238 - axial age introduced impersonal markets born of war which made it
    possible to treat neighbors as strangers
- 238 - human economies assume motives to be complex, no assumption that most
    self-interested motive is necessarily real one (could be trying to help a
    friend, hurt and enemy); similar in early credit markets where IOU value
    depends on character
- 238 - cash transactions only about figuring out proprtions, estimating
    quality, trying to get best deal of oneself
- 239 - axial age introduced profit and advantage as things people were really
    pursuing
- 240 - honor and glory became viewed as weaknesses, everything was cast as
    interest and advantage in manuals on statecraft from axial age
- 242 - only way to reject calculation and materialism as confucianism and
    taoism did is to live in a world where we made axial age assumptions about
    self-interested market transactions
- 245 - greeks talked about abstract substance that could become anything else,
    that's basically money
- 246 - debased currency retained same value at home, but abroad it was treated
    like the metal it was
- 247 - materialism common in axial age thought, religions before and after had
    more supernatural
- 249 - axial age religions emphasized pure greed, pure charity, concepts that
    barely existed before. pure greed, pure charity care complementary and
    neither can be imagined w/o another, could only arise when institutions
    insist on single-minded behavior; appear together when physical cash money
    appears
- 250 - religious movements often written off as escapist, but they were the
    only ones who abolished slavery, not insignificant historical achievements

## chapter ten: the middle ages
- 252 - even at height of dark ages, people still kept accounts in roman money
- 252 - serfs were way better off in the middle ages than axial age
- 254 - in india, money used likely used as accounting unit, not actually
    in exchange
- 254 - precious metal largely in temples, so leaders with axial age ambition
    w/ getting bullion to raise armies were explicitly anti-religious
- 255 - villages in india didn't use any metal currency despite wide variety
    of castes and responsibilites
- 257 - caste system persists when debt does not b/c debt implies equality;
    "Politically, it is never a particularly good idea to first tell people they 
    are your equals, and then humiliate and degrade them"; peasants fought to
    destroy debt before slavery + castes b/c this
- 258 - china could make anything into money by insisting taxes paid for in it
- 260 - china was ultimate anti-capitalist market state, refusing to work with
    capitalists to create monopoly. merchants seen with suspicion. commercial
    profit only viewed valid for labor expended in moving goods, not for
    speculation
- 262 - human economies apears impossible for people to conceive of pure
    selfishness and pure altruism. pure altruism is antisocial and inuman
- 265 - monasteries were like corporations, always seeking opportunity to grow
    wealth, continuously grow
- 268 - monastery commmunism became something very much like capitalism,
    constant need for expansion
- 269 - early paper contracts were cut in half w/ one kept by each party
- 270 - paper money originated as debt contracts, china took over b/c govt large
    and powerful enough, suspiscion of merchant class
- 274 - soldier in caliph's army earned 4x wages that roman legionary did
- 274 - islamic state army eventually became slaves; most other places didn't
    let slaves near weapons; here made a kind of sense - slaves people severed
    from society, but there was a wall between society and medieval islamic
    state (reminds me of conversation about opposition to citizen soldiers and
    belief that either be citizen or soldier)
- 275 - interest forbidden, but things bought on credit could be more expensive
    to incentivize credit as option
- 276 - checks did not become paper money b/c value tied to trust and reputation
- 277 - credit economy without state enforcement means value tied to reputation
- 277 - merchant became a paragon, like warrior w/ adventure but no harm
- 279 - specific arguments adam smith used originated in medieval persia
- 279 - smith said exchange is about self interest, islamic thinkers talked
    about it has extension of mutual aid
- 280 - emphasis on matching abilities (supply) and needs (demand), sounds like
    baseline communism
- 280 - muslim ethicists told merchants to bargain hard w/ rich so they could
    charge less w/ poor
- 281 - ghazali said gold + silver are good for nothing except coins, they can
    be symbols precisely b/c their uselessness
- 281 - ghazali says m-c-m' bad, money only exists to exchange items, needs to
    be in constant motion
- 282 - b/c no govt to enforce deals, everything about handshakes & honor, so
    it couldn't be the imagined world of self-interested people
- 286 - europe: former debt peons became serfs/vassals; not that different b/c
    both hypothetically voluntary
- 288 - kings used jews as pawns b/c only jewish people could lend money w/
    interest; they treated debts owed to jewish people as owed to themselves
- 289 - don't exaggerate jewish role in lending, most didn't have anything
    to do with it, were largely displaced by lombards and cahorsins by 1100
- 289 - mortgage loophole: buy a house for someone, "rent" it back to them until
    principal paid
- 291 - finance, trade, and violence linked tight compared to muslim world;
    christian assumption of commerce as usury
- 292 - asian empires typically separated sphere of warriors and merchants while
    in europe they overlapped
- 294 - chivalry and jousts were a way to keep knights out of trouble
- 296 - stories of knights are really just romantacized stories of merchants
- 297 - middle ages were cosmopolitan: monks in china studied sanskrit, students
    in indonesia debated in arabic; our image of middle ages as all about
    religion is legacy of enlightenment, only makes sense if you look at europe
- 298 - aristotle argued gold and silver have no intrinsic value, was just a
    social convention invented for exchange; view was widespread in middle ages
- 299 - rulers changed value of currency by issuing decree
- 301 - aristotle stated obvious in eyes of chinese theorists, money was
    whatever emperor established
- 302 - tally is really clever piece of technology, if each side agrees, it's
    valid
- 303 - confucian condemnation of merchant and islamic celebration actually
    ended up in the same place - flourishing markets, but no great merchant
    banks and industrial firms
- 303 - islamic example: marketplace did not fall under supervision of govt,
    honor and credit became indistinguishable; inevitable b/c you can't have
    cutthroat competition when violence is a real option; risk was assumed part
    of the deal and mechanisms to de-risk were considered impious
- 304 - chinese example: buddhist monasteries grew by effective risk-free
    investments; buddhism, unlike islam, produced effective corporations
- 304 - corporations in historical terms are strange and exotic

## chapter eleven: age of the great capitalist empires
- 309 - 15th century was festive in europe, 1/3-1/2 of year was feast days
- 311 - conquest of americas for precious metals partially driven by limitless
    demand from asia
- 314 - moral danger in looking at conquest of americas through economic lens -
    suggests conquerors were rational, that anyone would have done the same
- 319 - church was uncompromising against usury b/c it wasn't just a moral
    issue; money could become moral imperative itself
- 320 - cortes attempted to do axial age conquest with slaves running mines to
    pay soldiers and expand, but it failed
- 321 - it was only the islamic prohibition against usury that prevented an
    economic system that stood apart from the state
- 323 - growth of money treated as completely expected
- 325 - casimir got into debt was cruel similar to cortes: "the frantic urgency
    of having to convert everything around oneself into money, and rage and
    indignation at having been reduced to the sort of person who would do so"
- 327 - credit was common until quite recently, upends common assumptions that
    capitalism or the market rose b/c breakup of older systems and intro of
    cold calculation; in reality, villagers saw no contradiction
- 328 - trust ruled deals, reputation as important as net income
- 329 - markets were not seen as contradicting ethos of mutual aid, was an
    extension of mutual aid; b/c ran through trust and credit
- 330 - english saw credit as extension of human society
- 332 - idea that people are self-interested is rooted in christian assumption
    that we are all sinners
- 332 - capitalism originated not in the market but in moving from moral
    networks to impersonal power of state
- 334 - state started enforcing / criminalizing debt, communal solidarity likely
    ruined b/c violence was so accessible
- 336 - adam smith ignored benevolence and malevolence in economic affiars
- 338 - paper money started with muni bonds
- 339 - paper money was token of king's war debts owed by king
- 342 - newton thought there had to be physical basis to money or it wouldn't
    work (wrong lol)
- 346 - more labor out by physical force of the state
- 348 - joint stock companies popped up doing any number of stupid things (
    sounds like SV)
- 350 - african slaves in carolinas were first classified as contract labor
- 354 - nothing wrong w/ econ models inherently, just stupid to treat them as
    objective realities
- 359 - victorians shared near-universal belief capitalism would not be around
    forever

## chatper twelve: the beginning of something yet to be determined
- 362 - end of bretton woods meant that gold value went up relative to dollar
    and the us with a lot of gold gained a lot of value while poor countries
    without gold lost
- 364 - "governments borrow money to finance wars" idk not really
- 372 - discussion of treasuries as tribute, thought that was b/c trade
    deficits? idk seems extreme
- 374 - keynes knew money was created from thin air
- 375 - ricardo thought rentier aspect would only be temporary (i hope)
- 376 - rather than euthanize the rentiers, everyone became rentiers
- 377 - neoliberalism to graeber = organization of everything under capitalism
- 383 - we are historical actors, we can make a difference in world events
- 384 - history is not over (issac wilks vibes)
- 385 - earliest observable markets were effectively spillovers from
    administrative state in mesopotamia
- 385 - cash markets came from war
- 385 - state and market are two sides of same coin

## afterword
- 394 - tidy argument for anthropology: economists come at history with models
    and assumptions about people and arrange data around those. historians do
    not extrapolate at all, fully empirical. anthropologists are empirical but
    have a wealth of comparative material and can credibly speculate
