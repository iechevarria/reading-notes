the following are my personal notes on money and government. this is not a
summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## introduction

- 4 - stagnation of real earnings was deep cause of gfc, caused debt build-up
- 6 - economic ideas matter more now b/c economists make economic policy
- 11 - central question is what it always has been in political economy: what
    does govt need to do to securet smooth function of private economy (this
    hasn't always been the central question! see axial age empires, middle ages
    india - lots of central control where markets exist to benefit the state)
- 12 - dasgupta: "economic theory evolves in response to questions provoked by a
    given set of circumstances in the economy", as they change, theory changes
- 13 - economist justifications for free market more precise than business class
    "ideas are thus capable of making self-interest seem more enlightened"

## 1. the mysteries of money: a short history
- 25 - keynes thought liquidity preference existed b/c radical uncertainty
- 26 - coinage represents physical obligations to the state
- 28 - can inflate money instead of collecting taxes
- 29 - victorian fiscal constitution mandated balanced budget to prevent
    currency being debased
- 34 - quantity theory of money about supply of money, credit theory of money
    about demand for loans
- 35 - money is typically endogenous, sometimes exogenous as windfall like
    precious metals from south america into europe
- 38 - adam smith recognized supply of money should increase in line with demand

## 2. the fight for the gold standard
- 41 - locke: quantity of silver not objective measure of value, just more
    stabler than number of cows
- 43 - 1717 to ww1, inflation was 0.53%, avg magnitude of annual price changes
    was 4.42%
- 44 - "Like all social scientific analysis that claims to reduce the political
    to the natural, it was largely a cover for vested interest"
- 44 - gold too scarce, prevented expansion of money supply; money not
    automatically proportioned to need, has to be kept proportional
- 47 - real bills doctrine assumes full employment
- 47 - bank rate controls quantity of domestic credit
- 48 - malthus said ricardo abstracted too far from reality
- 49 - "One may feel that insistence on the need for short-run pain (e.g.
    austerity) for the sake of long-term gain, when the short-run can last
    decades and the long-run may never happen, testifies to a refined
    intellectual sadism."
- 51 - continuous fall in prices 1873 to 1896, called the great depression
- 53 - gold standard designed to prevent government over-spending, on the whole
    did work
- 55 - commitment to convertability reduced exchange risk -> expansion of trade
- 56 - currency convertability not threatened by democracy b/c limited suffrage
    and weak unions; unemployment emigrated from europe to america
- 56 - international trade was relatively non-competitive
- 57 - gold standard was cheap and efficient credt-rating agency
- 57 - european loans went to colonies which provided sheltered markets
- 58 - london functioned as international central authority / bank
- 59 - 'pound as good as gold' -> not convertability, but fiscal restraint
- 59 - british farming destroyed by cheap american imports

## 3. the quantity theory of money: from history to science
- 61 - wicksell: money supply created by banks through loans, central bank has
    indirect control by changing price of loans
- 63 - fisher and cambridge qtm present transactional view of money
- 64 - fisher and cambridge assume stable velocity of money, no change in demand
    for money; assume stable ratio of reserves to deposits
- 65 - qtm only valid with constant velocity
- 68 - governemnts do not have direct control of money supply
- 70 - wicksell adopted qtm for mechanism to manage economy fluctuations

## 4. the theory of the fertile and barren state
- 75 - keynes: limited effective demand prevents full potential output
- 77 - increased wealth only became state policy in 17th-18th centuries (what???
    this sounds unlikely! what about the mining operations in ancient greece)
- 82 - smith: mercantalist wars fought for state and vested interests, bad for
    the consumer
- 83 - smith: britain should not be empire "and endeavor to accomodate her
    future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances"
- 86 - income tax gave secure revenue base, made voters want cheap government
- 87 - british social reform driven by desire to compete with us, germany
- 90 - us got into deregulation, free trade in 1940s when it displaced britain
    as top dog
- 91 - rothschilds said they didn't want to lend money for war, but states that
    get in wars are strapped for cash and need to borrow, so kinda did
- 93 - "The history of fiscal theory shows that, far from being the scientific
    paragon it claims to be, it is highly ideological"

## 5. keynes's intervention
- 101 - central bank needs to create expectation that price level will not move
    too much from price of standard composite commodity
- 104 - austrians said 1929 crash caused by excessive credit creation, keynes
    thought it was 1928 interest rate hike which collapsed healthy boom
- 104 - schumpeter said let recession run its course, "Economists whose common
    sense had not been completely destroyed by their theories rejected the
    drastic cure of destroying the existing economy in order to rebuild it in
    the correct proportions."
- 106 - "There is no secure way of settling this argument."

    look at long-term trends as cycles?
