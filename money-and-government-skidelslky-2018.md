the following are my personal notes on money and government. this is not a
summary, these are just the ideas that are new to me or that stood out to me.

## introduction

- 4 - stagnation of real earnings was deep cause of gfc, caused debt build-up
- 6 - economic ideas matter more now b/c economists make economic policy
- 11 - central question is what it always has been in political economy: what
    does govt need to do to securet smooth function of private economy (this
    hasn't always been the central question! see axial age empires, middle ages
    india - lots of central control where markets exist to benefit the state)
- 12 - dasgupta: "economic theory evolves in response to questions provoked by a
    given set of circumstances in the economy", as they change, theory changes
- 13 - economist justifications for free market more precise than business class
    "ideas are thus capable of making self-interest seem more enlightened"

## 1. the mysteries of money: a short history
- 25 - keynes thought liquidity preference existed b/c radical uncertainty
- 26 - coinage represents physical obligations to the state
- 28 - can inflate money instead of collecting taxes
- 29 - victorian fiscal constitution mandated balanced budget to prevent
    currency being debased
- 34 - quantity theory of money about supply of money, credit theory of money
    about demand for loans
- 35 - money is typically endogenous, sometimes exogenous as windfall like
    precious metals from south america into europe
- 38 - adam smith recognized supply of money should increase in line with demand

## 2. the fight for the gold standard
- 41 - locke: quantity of silver not objective measure of value, just more
    stabler than number of cows
- 43 - 1717 to ww1, inflation was 0.53%, avg magnitude of annual price changes
    was 4.42%
- 44 - "Like all social scientific analysis that claims to reduce the political
    to the natural, it was largely a cover for vested interest"
- 44 - gold too scarce, prevented expansion of money supply; money not
    automatically proportioned to need, has to be kept proportional
- 47 - real bills doctrine assumes full employment
- 47 - bank rate controls quantity of domestic credit
- 48 - malthus said ricardo abstracted too far from reality
- 49 - "One may feel that insistence on the need for short-run pain (e.g.
    austerity) for the sake of long-term gain, when the short-run can last
    decades and the long-run may never happen, testifies to a refined
    intellectual sadism."
- 51 - continuous fall in prices 1873 to 1896, called the great depression
- 53 - gold standard designed to prevent government over-spending, on the whole
    did work
- 55 - commitment to convertability reduced exchange risk -> expansion of trade

## questions
- 17 - what precise mechanisms cause business cycles? is it actually prudent to
    look at long-term trends as cycles?
