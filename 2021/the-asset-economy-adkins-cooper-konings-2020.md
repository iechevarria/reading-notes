the following are my notes on the asset economy. this is not a summary. instead,
these are the ideas that caught my eye.

## introduction
- 2 - generational analysis big in public debate, out of style in academia
- 4 - should not be too quick to say neoliberalism is only about the 1%
- 5 - 'rentier function' has become embedded across soscial life as a whole
- 5 - "The key element shaping inequality is not longer the employment
    relationship, but rather whether one is able to buy assets that appreciate
    at a faster rate than both inflation and wages."
- 6 - income still matters, but less possible to enjoy middle class life on
    wages alone; asset ownership more important than employment for class
- 6 - growing importance of intergenerational transfer; this is not return to
    earlier era but instead logic of speculation with strategic fund transfers
- 6 - "The new logic of inequality has mixed 'hypercapitalist' logics of
    financialization with 'feudal' logics of inheritance"
- 7 - wages stagnate, so asset prices important to households and macro
- 10 - only way to buy property in western cities is w/ parental help
- 10 - intergenerational transfer of wealth has become key mechanism in new
    logic of class

## asset logics
- 13 - taking commodity as main form of capitalist economy lacks temporal
    dimension which lets us understand uncertainty + speculation in econ life
- 15 - if we use only consider commodity, there's no need for finance, so it
    just looks parasitic
- 15 - "Value is always an expectation-driven practice of valuation oriented
    towards an uncertain future."
- 16 - participation in modern economy means illiquid investments - makes more
    sense to call it asset economy than debt or financialized
- 16 - "The asset economy requires not low-commitment participation in trading,
    but investment and exposure."
- 17 - minskyian household: no longer unit of subsistence / consumption, but a
    balance sheet of assets and liabilities to be managed
- 19 - keynes held onto idea that long-run market outcome would reflect real
    value, reluctant to accept that beauty contest is core logic of econ life
- 20 - "Liquidity buys us the time we need to make our investments work out."
- 20 - idea that we invest and wait for investments to work out predicated on
    taking liquidity for granted
- 21 - keynesian household bought a house that didn't change much; minskyian
    household hopes to achieve capital gains on house, concerned w/ house as
    an asset
- 21 - minskyian household under pressure to invest in assets that will become
    object of others' self-interest + speculation, so will appreciate
- 24 - piketty focused on absence of policy mechanisms to stop accumulation,
    didn't pay attention to new patterns, emphasizes state capture
- 25 - piketty + others depict neoliberalism as return to earlier era
- 26 - naidu's wild piketty looks at politically, legally constructed nature of
    property rights + speculative character of capital
- 28 - buying a house not as easy as moving money from bank account to
    investment account - requires down payment + leverage; lump sum means
    intergenerational transfers needed even for fairly high incomes
- 28 - those who can't afford a down payment increasingly forced to put their
    income streams in service of others' asset accumulation, like long-term
    renter paying landlord's mortgage
- 29 - real estate doesn't change much, little innovation happening, so "it is
    very apparent to buyers themselves that their willingness to buy at a
    certain price is bound up not with any beliefs about true underlying values
    but about the future of market sentiment and expectations about what others
    will be willing to pay."
- 31 - scholars have trouble understanding why asset inflation so hard to stop
    politically despite destabilizing effects
- 31 - elites always have outsized influence, but this policy looks irrational
    to everyone involved, so need better explanation of how it persists in
    democracy
- 31 - need to appreciate that housing created middle class and neoliberal
    policy happened in setting where property ownership was democratized, so
    initially building on that legacy -> middle class invested in asset
    appreciation

## the making of the asset economy
- 33 - stagnant wages, high asset prices not a natural tendency: took effort
- 34 - middle class homeowners benefited most from inflation, saw mortgage
    burden depreciate in value
- 35 - inflation eroded wealth of top decile, throughout 70s wealthy scrambled
    for assets to protect them; corporate stock value down since mid 60s
- 35 - wage + consumer price inflation translated to asset deflation
- 40 - "Milton Friedman's 'monetarism' served as a technical pretext for the
    deliberate creation of a recession." -> caused unemployment that broke labor
    power
- 41 - since 80s, central banks okay w/ + encourage asset price inflation, stay
    vigilant on wage-push inflation
- 44 - thatcher understood emotional appeal of people participating in asset
    economy to make up losses on lost labour income, offered working-class
    residents opportunity to buy public housing assets -> provide literal buy-in
    to psychology of investment, have former dependents see themselves as
    investors and rentiers, not workers
- 46 - stock option revival in tech appealing to third way types who saw it as
    real embodiment of human capital
- 49 - not possible to square asset inflation with program of public investment,
    greenspan told clinton -> "It was one thing or the other: high asset prices
    or public sector abundance."
- 49 - govt took advantage of credit boom to push income-poor to invest in
    housing, causing cycle to push up housing prices, creating collateral that
    would allow more credit (sounds like minsky lol); greenspan urged clinton to
    use wealth effect and relax rules on credit (wow sounds like crisis origin)
- 50 - third way govts talk big about knowledge economy and end up resorting to
    asset (house or stocks) inflation
- 50 - impossible to create new class of high paid knowledge workers while also
    suppressing wages + doing austerity
- 50 - housing preferred instrument bc it was already democratized
- 51 - "The combination of inflated capital gains and deflated wages
    progressively closes the gates to newcomers, who struggle to buy their way
    into housing on wages along."

## new class realities
- 59 - analyses that focus on debt fail to recognize role of collateral: debt
    often necessary for asset holding
- 63 - oh no an actual class taxonomy ... this is nutty lol. doesn't account for
    the case of a renter who could afford a house but invests wages in different
    assets instead
- 67 - boomers make useful scapegoat to draw attention from class + to argue for
    austerity
- 69 - liquidity lifeblood of minskyian household more than keynesian household
- 72 - tadiar: some lives capitalized to yield future returns, others
    commodified, unable to store / retain value'; wrong for a few reasons
- 72 - necessary to save + invest bc welfare states weakened so private income
    now needed
- 73 - idea of bifurcation between asset economy and commodity prevents us from
    seeing that all of us are exposed to logic of asset appreciation, inflation
- 73 - wage deflation means human capital devalued even though education debt
    remains, like an underwater mortgage but undischargeable
- 73 - young graduates often drained of liquidity by ed debt, depriving them of
    opportunities for new investment + changing course
- 75 - future doesn't disappear under capitalism, southwood calls it frenetic
    inactivity or non-stop inertia 
- 75 - "What we end up with is an exhausting, nerve-racking combination of need
    for constant vigilance in combination with the absence of clear rewards."
- 75 - idea that generation locked out of asset ownership is inaccurate when you
    consider intergeneration transfers
- 76 - inheritance + living transfers important outside of even 1%

## conclusion
- 82 - minsky was post-foundationalist, moved away from idea that there's true/
    underlying value
- 85 - charge of commidification primarily cultural, accepts orthodox econ but
    with negative normative twist
- 87 - exclusion of housing from inflation doesn't match experience
- 89 - large parts of the electorates invested in ongoing asset price inflation,
    tax concessions, minimal inheritance tax -> housing generator of inequality
- 90 - piketty says it's natural economic laws, but it's better understood as
    a function of specific interests of specific constituencies / class; hard to
    cater to middle class without preventing entry of rest of society
- 91 - no easy way out of the asset economy
