## preface
- 8 - "If, as a personal matter, I have chosen not to make color pictures, it is because I have remembered how hard it is to write good free verse, with which color photography has some similarities, both being close to what occurs naturally."

## truth and landscape
- 14 - "Unspooiled places sadden us because they are, in an important sense, no longer true."
- 14 - landscape pictures have 3 truths: geography, autobiography, and metaphor
- 15 - "There is always a subjective aspect in landscape art, something in the picture that telss us as much about who is behind the camera as about what is in front of it."
- 15 - artist's decisions reflect personal experience, without which no way to know if scene is true
- 15 - "Making photographs has to be, then, a personal matter; when it is not, the results are not persuasive. Only the artist's presence in the work can convince us that its affirmation resulted from and has been tested by human experience."
- 16 - gardens like photographs - "sanctuaries not from but of truth"
- 16 - paradise comes from persian word meaning walled enclosure - best synopsis of what photographer sees through ground glass
- 19 - dag hammarskjold poem ends like this:
```
The seasons have changed
And the light
And the weather
And the hour
But it is the same land.
And I begin to know the map
And to get my bearings.
```

## beauty in photography
- 23 - "No ideas but in things." "Generalizations are impermissible unless they emerge before our eyes from specifics, from concrete evidence, from things."
- 23 - philosophy too easily foresakes details of experience
- 23 - discipline of aesthetics not helpful - "many writers and painters have demonstrated that thinking long about what art is or ought to be ruins the power to write or paint."
- 24 - "The job of the photographer, in my view, is not to catalogue indisputible fact but to try to be coherent about intuition and hope."
- 25 - form has beauty bc helps us meet fear that life is chaos, suffering is without meaning
- 25 - "We are compelled to understand Form by its fragmentary reflection in the daily objects around us; art will never fully define light."
- 25 - art abstracts, simplifies - "It is never exactly equal to life. In the visual arts, this careful sorting out in favor of order is called composition, and most artists know its primacy."
- 26 - ozu didn't care about continuity, said that nobody pays attention and that he should just focus on composition
- 26 - "Art takes liberties, then, to reveal shape."
- 26 - "I doubt that any great photographer ever starts because of amazement over his camera"
- 27 - how do we judge art? "by whether it reveals to us important Form that we ourselves have experienced but to which we have not paid adequate attention. Successful art *re*discovers Beauty for us."
- 27 - dead end of romantic vision is incoherence, of traditional values is cliche
- 28 - success of art can be judged by "the apparent ease of its execution. An artwork should not appear to have been hard work."
- 30 - little great art from tele lenses - "Instead their work is usually marked by an economy of means, an apparently everyday sort of relationship with their subject matter."
- 30 - most great work looks uncontrived, this is hardest work. why do it? "the deception is necessary if the goal of art is to be reached: only pictures that look as if they had been easily made can convincingly suggest Beauty is commonplace."
- 34 - art is only "partly sufficient" for dealing with suffering. it helps, but it's not all that matters.
- 34 - beauty can be alienating, sometimes just have to leave - "Sometimes it has been enough to search out a cafe blessed with jukebox, rattling dishes, and human voices. Family and friends are better though. What a relief there is in an anecdote, a jumping dog, or the brush of a hand. All these things are disorderly, but no plan for survival stands a chance without them."
