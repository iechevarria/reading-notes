- 12 - engineers have to unlearn CS education, cannot "safely abstract away from the physicality of the hardware on which his algorithms run" - "not an abstract information processor, but a material assemblage of plastic, metal, and silicon"
- 13 - algorithm isn't just recipe, it's specific language running on specific hardware
- 16 - in politics, things that are always important to other fields only become sporadically important
- 21 - incumbent exchanges profit from speed races by charging for connections, data

- 25 - 3 main signals: price movements in futures, order book balance, price movements on other exchanges
- 27 - "Liquidity, for example, is "sticky," in the sense that once traders expect a trading venue oto be the most liquid, it tends to remain so because they direct their trades there."
