the following are my notes on morals and markets. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that caught my eye.

- v - dedication to her parents "who would be my great fridns even if they were not my parents" - nice

## foreward (by kieran healy)
- xii - book explores culture / economic decisions as two-way conduits

## introduction
- xxiv - deterministic religious ethos (calvinism) rejected life insurance as sacreligious
- xxv - most sources from life insurance industry, still provide indicators of public opinion bc address common objections

## 1. historical and economic background
- 4 - union insurance co sold 12 policies, all to company officers
- 5 - trust departments succeeded while life insurance floundered
- 5 - 1840-1859 life insurance boomed $5 million -> $200 million in force

## 2. the persistent puzzle
- 12 - life insurance bigger in england than us bc more wage labour in england - life insurance replaces wage income
- 17 - govt backed life insurance immediately to alleviate responsibility for care
- 23 - effort to simplify policy language opposed by professor insurance joseph m belth bc "nobody's going to read it anyway"
- 25 - 1840s policy: 27.50 - 32.80 for $1k for 35 year old (!!! crazy expensive)

## 3. a comparative perspective
- 31 - fire and marine insurance sought by people, life insurance was not
- 33 - some said fire + marine was safer, in reality was much more haphazard than life
- 36 - acceptance of life insurance not greater in country where better understood or stats stronger
- 40 - life insurance unpopular in france but tontines were (???)
- 41 - ~400k people in tontines ~1850; annuities also popular
- 42 - french thought life of free person was not subject to appraisal, but were ok with life insurance on slaves

## 4. the impact of values and ideologies on the adoption of social innovations
- 45 - 5 qualities of innovation that's adopted:
    1. value compatibility
    2. relative advantage
    3. complexity
    4. triability
    5. observability
- 47 - sacred things: people don't deal with them in calculating, utilitarian manner
- 48 - 18th century churchgoers opposed census
- 48 - life insurance on pregnant women was acceptable
- 51 - as late as 1942, us more money spent on funerals than on hospitals + sanitaria
- 66 - afterworld retribution "reinforces the system of social control over the living by palcing it beyond human questioning"
- 68 - life insurance offers ability to exercise degree of control over living even after death
- 70 - in 1870 life insurance on men and property was accepted, but life insurance on women seen as greedy, reduces them to objects

## 5. life, chance, and destiny
- 74 - 1830s land ventures collapsed (land speculation again)
- 79 - gambling creates artificial risk, insurance reduces risk
- 81 - origins of life insurance as wager on life made all that followed seem illegitimate
- 83 - common for life opponents to buy fire or marine
- 85 - inequality attributed to divine providence, suffering of the poor part of the plan
- 87 - in 1925 rabbi argued for life insurance, saying it wasn't opening oneself up to trouble but instead preparing for inevitability + if life insurance caused death, insurers would go out of business
- 91 - england banned gambling not for moral reasons but bc legal enforcement was nuisance
- 97 - life insurance took business from banks, reduced saving
- 98 - ironically, arguments for life insurance work for social security, but insurers against that "The ultimate justification for the defense of voluntary institutions did not hinge on issues of economic efficiency, but once again morality was at stake."

## 6. marketing life: moral persusasion and business enterprise
- 115 - life insurance seen as a way for people to marry younger so they didn't have to accumulate savings
- 122 - in 1870s, companies stopped selling on protection "to concentrate on policyholder moneymaking"
- 124 - key-man insurance finds precedence in insurance of skilled slaves
- 126 - insurance, birth control, vaccines see low adoption bc not very visible
- 133 - merton + barber: when expectations for a role are mutually exclusive / inconsistent, behavior oscillates -> life insurance will likely continue to oscillate between calculation and emotion

## 7. the life insurance agent: problems in occupational prestige and professionalization
- 136 - agents originated in england to find low risk people; in us they were professionals who did it on the side
- 139 - unsolicited applications were suspect, subject to extra examinations
- 140 - savings bank insurance was cheaper bc no agents, only got 6% mkt share
- 142 - interpersonal channels important for innovation adoption + face to face needed to deal with death
- 146 - solicitors incentivized to recommend most expensive policy, not best b/c commission structure
- 147 - henry b hyde used extra commission, bonuses, prizes to get agents to sell more
- 149 - life agent had higher status with lower class than middle
- 149 - life agent welcome in rural areas as symbol of black success
- 153 - life agents paid well but high turnover
- 154 - hendrick: rivalry between insurers fought over new agents, not new policies
- 155 - life agents have no power to make binding contract / settle claims unlike fire / marine
- 156 - life agents low status bc close to death in a moneymaking way (unlike physician / clergyman who are close to death in service way)
- 158 - life agents like undertakers, try to legitimate business by adopting sacred role -> undertaker has "home" or "chapel", not factory or office
- 159 - superiors didn't like having to have life agents
- 160 - typical customer didn't discriminate between life companies or policies
- 161 - rebating (taking discount out of commission) / twisting (canceling old policy and selling new one) were the only way to sell - once critical mass hit, everyone had to do both
- 163 - 1905 armstrong investigation limited commissions
- 163 - underwriters made formal organization in 1890

## conclusions
- 172 - clergy split on life insurance - some denounced life insurance others saw entrepeneurial potential, got in on it
- 176 - care for widows and orphans went from responsibility of community to responsiblity of nuclear family + paid professionals; similar process with physical care of the dead with undertakers in 19th century
- 176 - "America was, and remains, a land of economic magic. In the case of life insurance the trick was to sell futuresâ€“pessimistic futures."
