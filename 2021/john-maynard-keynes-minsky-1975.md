the following are my notes on john maynard keynes. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that caught my eye.

## preface
- ix - leveraged wagers mean small disappointments cause big consequences

## introduction
- xiv - policies adopted by self-identified keynesians hurt credibility of keynes's general theory, led to neoclassical econ

# TODO: return if introduction points not covered later on

## chapter 1. the general theory and its interpretation
- 2 - "Keynes attacked with gusto and obvious relish the logical and empirical foundations of traditional economics"
- 4 - "With this victory by the classical theory, academic economics has recaptured much of the sterility and irrelevance ... which characterized the discipline prior to the appearance of *The General Theory*"
- 5 - henry simons: bank weakness + human error caused depression -> "As it is always possible after the event of a crash or a crisis to impute what went wrong to some human error or institutional flaw, the Simons position is essentially irrefutable" - it's also the idolatry critique!
- 7 - "out of an understanding that the Left had the questions but not the answers, *The General Theory* was born" - union of rationality of econ + sentiment that something better than what exists is attainable
- 7 - keynes provided alternative to marxists and orthodox econ who basically believed the same pessimistic things
- 9 - on modern literature + econometric analysis: "By their very nature, such studies, based as they are upon erroneous premises, *cannot* determine relevant investment relations. As many things happen together and as econometricians are skilled in massaging data, even such poorly conceived studies may satisfy merely statistical tests of adequacy."
- 15 - when things are stable for a while, people doubt that crisis happens -> "That is, the view arises that the disturbing problem that established a need for a new theory 'never' really occurred."
- 15 - "It turns out that the accomplishments of pure theory during the 1950s and 1960s are more apparent than real"

## chapter 2. the conventional wisdom: the standard intrepretation of keynes
- 20 - keynesians changed keynes's work by making labor market set stage for all others - "not only thoroughly violates the spirit of *The General Theory* but it also returns the argument to the world of the "classical economy""
- 20 - neoclassical synthesis adds rigidities / institutioonal flaws to explain unemployment
- 20 - "These models become the rationale for an activist, managed approach to economic policy in a capitalist economy and for the view that fundamental reforms are not necessary."
- 21 - most keynesian policy discussion based on consumption function, exclude models w/ monetary + investment interactions
- 22 - "in Keynes's scheme the rate of interest is *not* homogenous of degree zero with respect to the quantity of money; in the orthodox scheme of things this heroic assumption is crucial to the argument."
- 23 - gt uses consumption function to get determined component of aggregate demand, not the heart of macroeconomics
- 26 - when consumption externally financed (like consumer credit), neoclassical consumption smoothing assumptions don't apply bc units have cyclical + uncertain view of income over time -> consumption behaves procyclically
- 31 - econometrics bad at estimating investment, need to rely on surveys
- 31 - "The failure, or success, of the financially naïve econometric forecasting models does not constitute a test of the validity of Keynes's theory."
- 32 - hicks is-lm model similar to viner's understanding of gt, keynes wrote extended repudiation of viner's interpretation, so hicks also wrong
- 35 - is-lm vioaltes complexity of investment process laid out by keynes
- 37 - hicks-hansen model better than simple consumption-function models, but "was an unfair and naïve representation of Keynes's subtle and sophisticated views."
- 39 - keynes: increase in quantity of money will affect prices bc it first affects labor market, so labor market is conduit for monetary change to price change -> classical view that money supply determines price not reliable / precise
- 40 - system performance determines real terms of contract struck in monetary / nominal terms -> introduces uncertainty beyond control of individuals
- 41 - equations have equilibrium between wage and employment -> "In the classsical economics it is blithely assumed that there exists processes in markets which assure that this real wage and employment will be achieved."
- 47 - keynes: reaction to disequilibrium in one market can cause disequilibrium in other markets
- 47 - many smaller markets might have price declines, won't effect other markets; classical view treats labor market this way -> in reality likely to spill over into other markets
- 51 - neoclassicals said wage rigidities caused unemployment -> "This pointing at labor-market sluggishness or rigidity with respect to money wages as the villain of the piece contrasts with Keynes's view that wage flexibility, if it occurred, might very well make things worse."

## chapter 3. fundamental perspectives
- 55 - joan robinson: "Keynes' argument was not the one that has been foisted on him by the bastard Keynesians - that money-wage rates are rigid for institutional reasons. It was that if wages could be cut, in a slump, it would make the situation worse..."
- 59 - "Every reference by Keynes to an equilibrium is best interpreted as a reference to a transitory set of system variables toward which the economy is trending"
- 59 - "Not only is stability and unattainable goal; whenever something approaching stability is achieved, destabilizing processes are set off."
- 62 - sometimes decisions need to be made but cannot be quantified bc lack of knowledge - call these subjective probabilities -> subject to sudden, violent changes
- 65 - keynes has theory of cycle based in investment, consumption is passive amplifier
- 66 - "Thus the behavior of the economy is characterized by equilibrating tendencies rather than by any achieved equilibrium. Keynesian economics as the economics of didequilibrium is the economics of permanent disequilibrium."

## chapter 4. capitalist finance and the pricing of capital assets
- 68 - two main decisions for units: which assets to hold, how to finance acquisition
- 69 - ordinary businesses need production output + labor markets to work but also financial markets to work so can borrow, sell assets, float shares
- 70 - "In a world with private debts denominated in money, money is a safe asset for meeting such commitments."
- 70 - money invariant in value only wrt contracts / commitments denominated in money
- 70 - "The relevant paradigm for the analysis of a capitalist economy is not a barter economy; the relevant paradigm is a system with a City or a Wall Street where asset holdings as well as current transactions are financed by debts."
- 70 - liabilities are what buys capital assets - holder of bank deposit indirectly financing position in capital assets
- 71 - "The possession of money - and of financial assets that are near monies, i.e., savings accounts, certificates of deposits, etc. - acts as "insurance" against the economy, or particular markets, behaving in an inappropriate way"
- 71 - cash is insurance against fall in cash from default on contracts or malfunctioning of markets
- 74 - interest rate determined by interplay of public demand to borrow, bank willingness to lend
- 74 - keynes: speculative demand for money tied to interest rates + asset prices
- 75 - "In a world with uncertainty, portfolios are of necessity speculative" -> demand for money as insurance
- 79 - rate of return on asset inversely related w/ quality of market for asset, time to maturity, ease / certainty of sale price (liquidity)
- 83 - organization w/ high volume of short liabilities is refinancing its position every time short debt comes due (this is banking - borrow short, lend long)
- 85 - to buy expensive assets, debt needed - safest way is to emit debt w/ cash-flow commitments synchronized w/ expected cash receipts - minsky calls this "hedge financing"
- 87 - keynes: "When the capital development of acountry becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done."
- 87 - firm does successful speculation -> firm value increases -> firm can issue more debt bc debt-to-valuation ratio down
- 87 - increase in quantity of money relative to assets + debts decreases liquidity premium on money -> increase money price of debts, capital assets
- 88 - prospective yields and liquidity premiums reflect view about future, subject to sudden + violent changes

## chatper 5. the theory of investment
- 91 - keynes: "it is those which determien the rate of investment which are most unreliable, since it is they which are influenced by our views of the future about which we know so little"
- 93 - prospective yields Qs "embody present views about the future," subject to change
- 94 - Qs are quasi-rents, not marginal productivity of capital, result of scarcity of capital
- 101 - if capital assets less liquid than debts, if value of liquidity decreases, price of capital assets rise relative to money + debts
- 101 - interest rate on money loans can get so low tht increase in money supply will not effectively lower rate of interest
- 102 - finite max price of capital asset that can be achieved by increasing money supply
- 103 - slippages between quantity of money and amount of investment, "an erratic tune caller for investment."
- 107 - borrowers see debt cash flows certain, prospective yeilds uncertain, so more debt finance means less margin of security
- 107 - "Borrower's risk is subjective; it never appears on signed contracts. It is a focal point for the "quivers and quavers" of uncertainty and the "surprise" of high animal spirits."
- 108 - as contractual debt rises, all debt issued by unit will need to conform to marginal contract upon refinancing
- 108 - fundamental fact about borrower / lender risk is they reflect subjective valuations
- 109 - existence of borrower / lender risk means successful operation means capital appreciation
- 109 - "The Shakespearean dictum "Neither a borrower nor lender be" fails to take into account the capital gains both parties can enjoy."
- 109 - less risk aversion means more leverage - "capital appreciation uncovers borrowing power"
