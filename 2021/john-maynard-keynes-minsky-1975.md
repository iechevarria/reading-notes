the following are my notes on john maynard keynes. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that caught my eye.

## preface
- ix - leveraged wagers mean small disappointments cause big consequences

## introduction
- xiv - policies adopted by self-identified keynesians hurt credibility of keynes's general theory, led to neoclassical econ

# TODO: return if introduction points not covered later on

## chapter 1: the general theory and its interpretation
- 2 - "Keynes attacked with gusto and obvious relish the logical and empirical foundations of traditional economics"
- 4 - "With this victory by the classical theory, academic economics has recaptured much of the sterility and irrelevance ... which characterized the discipline prior to the appearance of *The General Theory*"
- 5 - henry simons: bank weakness + human error caused depression -> "As it is always possible after the event of a crash or a crisis to impute what went wrong to some human error or institutional flaw, the Simons position is essentially irrefutable" - it's also the idolatry critique!
- 7 - "out of an understanding that the Left had the questions but not the answers, *The General Theory* was born" - union of rationality of econ + sentiment that something better than what exists is attainable
- 7 - keynes provided alternative to marxists and orthodox econ who basically believed the same pessimistic things
- 9 - on modern literature + econometric analysis: "By their very nature, such studies, based as they are upon erroneous premises, *cannot* determine relevant investment relations. As many things happen together and as econometricians are skilled in massaging data, even such poorly conceived studies may satisfy merely statistical tests of adequacy."
- 15 - when things are stable for a while, people doubt that crisis happens -> "That is, the view arises that the disturbing problem that established a need for a new theory 'never' really occurred."
- 15 - "It turns out that the accomplishments of pure theory during the 1950s and 1960s are more apparent than real"

## things to look up
- 16 - joan robinson on bastard keynesianism
