the following are my notes on how to do nothing. this is not a summary. instead,
these are the ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye

## introduction: surviving uselessness
- ix - "nervous feeling, of being overstimulated and unable to sustain a train
    of thought"
- ix - much of what gives life meaning happens in "off time" that mechanistic
    view seeks to eliminate
- xi - book for "any person who perceives life to be *more than an instrument*
    and therefore something that cannot be optimized"
- xi - "Unless we are vigilant, the current design of much of our technology
    will block us every step of the way, deliberately creating false targets for
    self-reflection, curiosity, and a desire to belong to a community."
- xii - commercial social media has "incentive to keep us in a profitable state
    of anxiety, envy, and distraction"
- xxii - "simple awareness is the seed of responsibility"

## chapter 1: the case for nothing
- 5 - "existing things infinitely more interesting than anything I could
    possibly make" - totally agree, real life is super neat, think that's why I
    love candid photos of real places, nathan for you, how to w/ john wilson
- 7 - deep listening meant to create "heightened sense of receptivity" -> sounds
    like stephen shore how to see video
- 12 - "just becaus ethis right is denied to many people doesn't make it any
    less of a right or any less important"
- 13 - eight hours to do what we will: leisure might be there, but best way to
    "descibe that period is to refuse to define it"
- 18 - berardi on lack of repression in italy: "relies on proliferation of
    chatter , the irrelevance of opinion and discourse, and on making thought,
    dissent, and critique banal and ridiculous", censorship marginal compared to
    "immense informational overload and an actual siege of attention"

## chapter 2: the impossibility of retreat
- 34 - digital distraction not bad b/c productivity hit, but bc it wastes your
    life
- 38 - "they show how easily and imagined apolitical 'blank slate' leads to a
    technocratic solution where design has replaced politics"
- 42 - hardest decisions in commune about privacy, individual vs house, that is,
    "the very fundamentals of governance"
- 42 - commune member: "the tyranny of everyone doing their own thing"
- 48 - skinner "proposed avoiding politics altogether" and said we should just
    design culture
- 49 - "the locus of power is carefully hidden in Thiel's language, either
    disappearing into the passive voice or being associated with abstractions
    like design or technology"
- 52 - arendt: unpredictability + plurality of agents mean politics gotta happen
    and design won't suffice
- 52 - "Politics necessarily exist between two individuals with free will; any
    attemt to reduce politics to design (Thiel's 'machinery of freedom') is also
    an attempt to reduce people to achines or mechanical beings"
- 55 - epicurus used his garden to publish writings of the school, showed care
    for outside world
- 55 - experiments in retreating only valuable in exchange with outside world
- 55 - leguin: "The explorer who will not come back or send back his ships to
    tell his tale is not an explorer, only and adventurer"

## chapter 3: anatomy of a refusal
- 68 - on diogenes: "he neither assimilated to nor fully exited society; instead
    he lived in the midst of it, in a permanent state of refusal"
- 70 - bartleby's "I would prefer not to" -> "he not only will not do what he is
    asked, he answers in a way that negates the terms of his question"
