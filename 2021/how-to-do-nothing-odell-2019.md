the following are my notes on how to do nothing. this is not a summary. instead,
these are the ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye

## introduction: surviving uselessness
- ix - "nervous feeling, of being overstimulated and unable to sustain a train
    of thought"
- ix - much of what gives life meaning happens in "off time" that mechanistic
    view seeks to eliminate
- xi - book for "any person who perceives life to be *more than an instrument*
    and therefore something that cannot be optimized"
- xi - "Unless we are vigilant, the current design of much of our technology
    will block us every step of the way, deliberately creating false targets for
    self-reflection, curiosity, and a desire to belong to a community."
- xii - commercial social media has "incentive to keep us in a profitable state
    of anxiety, envy, and distraction"
- xxii - "simple awareness is the seed of responsibility"

## chapter 1: the case for nothing
- 5 - "existing things infinitely more interesting than anything I could
    possibly make" - totally agree, real life is super neat, think that's why I
    love candid photos of real places, nathan for you, how to w/ john wilson
- 7 - deep listening meant to create "heightened sense of receptivity" -> sounds
    like stephen shore how to see video
- 12 - "just becaus ethis right is denied to many people doesn't make it any
    less of a right or any less important"
- 13 - eight hours to do what we will: leisure might be there, but best way to
    "descibe that period is to refuse to define it"
- 18 - berardi on lack of repression in italy: "relies on proliferation of
    chatter , the irrelevance of opinion and discourse, and on making thought,
    dissent, and critique banal and ridiculous", censorship marginal compared to
    "immense informational overload and an actual siege of attention"

## chapter 2: the impossibility of retreat
- 34 - digital distraction not bad b/c productivity hit, but bc it wastes your
    life
- 38 - "they show how easily and imagined apolitical 'blank slate' leads to a
    technocratic solution where design has replaced politics"
- 42 - hardest decisions in commune about privacy, individual vs house, that is,
    "the very fundamentals of governance"
- 42 - commune member: "the tyranny of everyone doing their own thing"
- 48 - skinner "proposed avoiding politics altogether" and said we should just
    design culture
- 49 - "the locus of power is carefully hidden in Thiel's language, either
    disappearing into the passive voice or being associated with abstractions
    like design or technology"
- 52 - arendt: unpredictability + plurality of agents mean politics gotta happen
    and design won't suffice
- 52 - "Politics necessarily exist between two individuals with free will; any
    attemt to reduce politics to design (Thiel's 'machinery of freedom') is also
    an attempt to reduce people to achines or mechanical beings"
- 55 - epicurus used his garden to publish writings of the school, showed care
    for outside world
- 55 - experiments in retreating only valuable in exchange with outside world
- 55 - leguin: "The explorer who will not come back or send back his ships to
    tell his tale is not an explorer, only and adventurer"

## chapter 3: anatomy of a refusal
- 68 - on diogenes: "he neither assimilated to nor fully exited society; instead
    he lived in the midst of it, in a permanent state of refusal"
- 70 - bartleby's "I would prefer not to" -> "he not only will not do what he is
    asked, he answers in a way that negates the terms of his question"
- 76 - thoreau hoped if enough individuals exercised moral judgement instead of
    just playing the game, the game might change. individual -> collective
- 77 - collective alignment emerges from individual self-discipline -> cause
    spectacle of noncompliance that registers at public scale
- 82 - refusal isn't a reaction, it's a decision that requires commitment
- 83 - students often front line of refusal - black students were advised +
    aided by profs, were under care of college, not at mercy of white employer
- 91 - tanner on digital detox: "They reinforce neoliberal ideals, privileging
    the on-the-move individual whose time needs to be well spent - a neatly
    consumerist metaphor."
- 93 - modernity is demanding, so "*attention may be the last resource we have to withdraw*"
- 94 - economy takes for granted attention being uniform
- 94 - not everyone can opt out, so "This is why it's even more important for
    anyone who *does* have a margin - even the tiniest one - to put it to use in
    opening up margins further down the line. Tiny spaces can open up small
    spaces, small spaces can open bigger spaces. If you can afford to pay a
    different kind of attention, you should."

## chapter 4: exercises in attention
- 98 - hockney on picasso: "To him, cubism was quite simple: three noses meant
    you looked at it three times"
- 101 - hockney: looking a skill, people rarely practice
- 104 - attention + curiosity lets us avoid instrumental understanding, seeing
    people one-dimensionally / as product of function -> consider deepth of
    their existence
- 107 - being that cannot be understood / interpreted, only perceived -> demands
    constant attention, ongoing state of encounter
- 108 - what you see depends on how you look and for how long
- 110 - lots of stuff we see gets processed out unconsciously, only with
    attention is there perception
- 113 - william james + von helmholtz: no sustained attention, just successive
    efforts to bring attention back to the same thing
- 116 - odell on vivrekar: some argue that "we should focus on empowering people
    to have more self control (that's me!)" - vivrekar says persuasion a given,
    all we can do is redirect it
- 117 - "What does persuasive design look like when someone else tries to bring
    out my 'aspirational self,' and does it for profit? Help!"
- 118 - vivrekar assumes shallow types of attention that can be directed w/ bad
    or good aims; "We might extrapolate from this to conclude that deeper,
    hardier, more nuanced forms of attention are less susceptible to
    appropriation, because discipline and vigilance inhere within them."
- 120 - "Significantly, these encounters are not optimized to 'empower' us by
    making us happier or more productive"
- 121 - william james: "My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those
    iteams which I notice shape my mind - without selective interest, experience
    is an utter chaos."

## chapter 5: ecology of strangers
- 137 - on spotify recs: "By contrast, at its most successful, an algorithmic
    'honing in' would seem to incrementally entomb me as an ever-more stable
    image of what I like and why ... When the language of advertising and
    personal branding enjoins you to 'be yourself,' what it really means is 'be
    more yourself,' where 'yourself' is a consistent and recognizable pattern of
    habits, desires, and drives that can be more easily advertised to"
- 138 - "If I think I know everything that I want and like, and I also think I
    know where and how I'll find it - imagining all of this stretching endlessly
    into the future without any threats to my identity or the bounds of what I
    call my self - I would argue that I no longer have a reason to keep living.
    After all, if you were reading a book whose pages began to seem more and
    more similar until you were reading that same page over and over again, you
    would put the book down." -> completely disagree. if there's beauty in it,
    it's totally fine. good even. utterly unrelatable
- 139 - newcomers were "not only uninterested in learning anything about the
    incredibly dynamic place they had moved to, but ignorant of their role in
    destroying that dynamism"
- 139 - tragic thing about mind that views itself as separate, defensible,
    capable of efficiency is that it's based on fallacy of self being separate
    from others + the world
- 142 - "there is an important distinction to make between isolating oneself
    versus removing oneself from the clamor and undue influence of public
    opinion"
- 144 - someone asks author if using app to id plants alienated her from
    landscape, but she said it was needed as crutch to help her ignorance ->
    first step in seeing individual plants and not "greenery"
- 145 - "Eventually, to behold is to become beholden to"
- 151 - reality is blobby, refuses systematization, so american obsession with
    individualism, personal branding, competition, striving does violence to
    human society
- 154 - attention forms ground for ethics bc we choose who we see / hear

## chapter 6: restoring the grounds for thought
- 156 - she calls crow swarms "Crow Burning Man" -> gotta steal that
- 161 - meyrowitz: public by default means two possiblities: either offend
    somebody or be so bland you won't offend anyone
- 162 - can't strategize what to say wrt who is present online
- 163 - public by default means it's harder to change your mind
- 164 - barassi quoting ecological activist: "Online censorship is applied
    through the excess of banal content that distracts people from serious or
    collective issues."
- 165 - barassi quoting again: "So technologies have made people come together
    but what made the movement so powerful was the physical space, the process
    of discussion, and reflection and the availability of the people to sit down
    and discuss without the pressure of time"
- 177 - when you can choose your audience, a third space -> "In this form of
    encounter, neither I nor anyone else has to waste time or energy on
    wrangling context, or packaging our messages for the lowest common
    denominator of public opinion. We gather, we say what we mean, and then we
    act."
- 179 - meet with a core like montgomery bus boycott, decide how to speak to
    public at large, make those decisions behind closed doors
- 181 - to prevent context collapse, need physical spaces to meet
- 184 - stopped looking at phone as much these days -> "I stopped looking at my
    phone becuase I was looking at something else, something so absorbing I
    couldn't turn away."

# conclusion: manifest dismantling
- 199 - techies banning tech for kids: "In their own ways, both of these things
    suggest to me the frightening potential of something like gated communities
    of attention: privileged spaces where some (but not others) can enjoy the
    fruits of contemplation and the diversification of attention."
- 199 - we can try to stop addictive nature of tech + also labor, women, racism,
    indigenous, parks, habitat restoration
- 201 - walter benjamin: history has elements of what we need to solve these
    problems, -> dig up this impulse, make past live in present, do it justice
