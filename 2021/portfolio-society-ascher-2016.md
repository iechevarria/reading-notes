the following are my notes on portfolio society. this is not a summary. instead,
these are the ideas that caught my eye.

## preface - the specter of wall street
- 15 - contra marx, modern "economic cell form" portfolio society is not
    commodity but instead security

## chapter one - capitalism: a horror story
- 24 - portfolio society is where capital's relation to future mediated by
    finance, not exchange as in civil society
- 26 - "After all, does it not appear that risk, rather than labor, is now
    considered the fount of value" - sounds like adkins in time of money
- 27 - "What would it mean, then (with apologies to Marx and Thomas Piketty) to
    write *Capital* in the twenty-first century?" - lol
- 28 - "This chapter may be especially trying for French readers who - according
    to Marx - are notoriously impatient"

## chatper two - a monstrous collection of securities
- 43 - labor theory of value derived from average productivity of all workers
- 44 - sharpe's theory does a similar kind of aggregation wrt to portfolio
- 45 - marx: "all commodities are merely definite quantities of congealed
    labor-time"
- 45 - securities have value as hedges b/c they are quantities of congealed risk
- 46 - social character of risk is that it is taken and shared among people but
    it appears as if it is between securities themselves in a portfolio
- 50 - black-scholes serves as universal financial device that allows all
    speculation to appear as a volatility; makes it possible for participants to
    take / share risks but make it appear as if securities themselves share risk
    (so this is a comparison to commodity money)
- 55 - marx was dismissive of relgiousity, but you can look at prayer like a
    low-cost financial derivative with huge potential payoff
- 59 - marx said people would ideally decide wat is produced, author says that
    also means a world where people decide which possibilities are to be
    pursued, which risks taken / avoided, so means of prediction would be held
    in common, so security fetishism could be avoided
- 61 - "Today, if I were to claim that the likelihood of a Greek government
    default stands in a relation - any relation - to the likelihood of a
    hurricane flooding the city of Orlando, the absurdity of the claim would
    also be manifest. Yet as our own analysis suggests, the categories of
    contemporary financial economics consist of precisely such absurdities" ->
    yeah the absurdity is what makes it useful! where absurdity is lack of
    correlation, you want things that aren't correlated, which I guess looks
    absurd

## chapter three - finding safety in numbers: inside the hidden abode of prediction
- 64 - marx has quaintness wrt value, nobody talks about labor value anymore
- 72 - "revolver" - borrower who can only pay small interest each month, but who
    doesn't default (more concrete desciption of adkins's payment vs repayment)
- 74 - encourage homeownership for workers bc people with mortgages don't strike
- 74 - "If Moneybags knew that he could find someone else to buy the debt before
    it came to maturity, the reasoning went, perhaps he might be more inclined
    to make the loan in the first place" - duh! of course! people like
    liquidity, and for good reason!
- 78 - "it is also clear that the creditor finds himself in a position not only
    to extract interest from his debtors, but also to borrow (and bet) more
    money than he has lent - as if somehow by appropriating other people's
    promise-making abilities, he had become more credible himself" - also
    applicable to landlording
- 79 - "concealing ... the dense social relations ... that are required for such
    a portfolio to exist in the first place" -> konings would say this
    concealment it useful! sucks to have to think about all the stuff,
    abstraction is useful
- 81 - means of prediction valuable in portfolio society -> computer power +
    algorithmic knowledge (dunno if computers matter as much)

## chapter four - from vagabond to subprime: the making of *homo probabilis*
- 86 - enclosement created class of individuals free to work but also without
    any choice but to work
- 88 - similar to enclosement in england, end of welfare state + keynesianism
    meant atomization, need to work
- 98 - experience of present-day borrowers much closer to workers than displaced
    peasants after enclosure - more about losing money than losing freedom /
    life
- 99 - "It is clearly the case that borrowers are pitted against each other" - 
    is it really??? does paying your bill actually hurt someone??? thought
    credit scores were more direct estimations of likelihood to pay, not ranking
    of likelihood to pay
- 100 - "to the extent that an individual's risk profile comes to determine the
    terms on which they are allowed to borrow, the more 'objectively' risk is
    measured, the more 'objective' it becomes - that is, the more it comes to
    govern social life reflexively, most amplifying what social patterns already
    exist - but doing so under cover of scientific neutrality" -> more conrete
    framing here would help: perceived higher likelihood of default -> higher
    interest rate / harsher terms -> actual higher likelihood of default /
    missed payments (do credit scores adjust for this reflexivity?)
- 106 - apostles of neoliberalism know that homo probabilis doesn't exist in
    wild: needs to be created

## chapter five - when goldman broke the law
- 109 - "whose love letters we so indelicately quoted in the opening pages of
    this book" lmao
- 116 - tourre's (goldman guy who did securities fraud) greatest sin was that he
    "revealed that it is always *possible* to cheat", he revealed that "markets
    are indeed 'made,' and made by individuals who are inevitably embedded in
    unequal relations of power" -> he structured a CDO or something with a bunch
    of mortgages some prominent guy chose and wanted to take a short position
    on, and then didn't tell the counterparties that this guy chose the stuff
    and was short on the stuff inside the security
- 118 - "The initial borrowers remain exposed to the elements and stand
    potentially to lose their houses, but thanks to the wonders of
    securitization, the lenders, at least, have found other individuals to bear
    their burden" -> borrowers do benefit, they get lower interest rate than
    otherwise, that's why securitization emerged
- 121 - "I wonder, though, whether it might be the racetrack, rather than the
    casino, that provides the better metaphor - or better yet, the bettor
    metaphor" - lol

## general comments
- 43 - text quote blocks in the middle of paragraphs are weird / annoying
- 146 - very funny lion king bit about the lions saving for a cub's college fund
     in the endnotes
- 154 - love that the endnotes include something like 'notes to pages 52-55'
    next to the page number. super thoughtful.
