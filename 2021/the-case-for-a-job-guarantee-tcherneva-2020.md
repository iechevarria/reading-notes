the following are my notes on the case for a job guarantee. this is not a
summary. instead, these are the ideas that caught my eye.

## 2: a steep price for a broken status quo
- 23 - unemployment is unique bc there's this idea that there's a non-zero
    optimal level of unemployment: NAIRU; would be nuts to think this way about
    homelessness or illiteracy
- 26 - "It is hard not to conclude that the NAIRU has provided cover for the
    profound policy failure of tackling unemployment head on."
- 29 - people who need work most, long term unemployed, have most barriers to
    employment
- 36 - joblessness can lead to personal + health problems that prevent person
    from getting a job again
- 37 - most costs of unemployment are non-monetary: suggests that just providing
    income to unemployed would be inadequate

## 3: the job guarantee: a new social contract and macroeconomic model
- 48 - precedent for job guarantee: buffer stock program where govt buys
    commodity, preventing it from going below price floor, then sells it back ->
    maintains price floor + employs the commodity
- 48 - minimum wage is a weak floor bc it doesn't extend to unemployed
- 50 - "It is indefensible on both economic and moral grounds to have run full
    employment and price support programs for agricultural commodities or gold,
    without doing the same for jobseekers."
- 52 - no limit to budget that would be necessary to coax firms to full
    employment
- 55 - families on short unemployment benefits cut spending much more than those
    who have guaranteed job option
- 57 - job guarantee job creation wouldn't rely on interstate competition for
    firm subsidies

## 4: but how will you pay for it?
- 80 - we currently use public purse to fund unemployment regime when instead we
    should fund an employment regime -> seems like covid throws a wrench in
    this, seems like we need both in pandemic conditions

## 5: what where, and how: jobs, design, and implementation
- 90 - in 1949, minimum wage doubled without accelerating inflation in a time
    when economy was near full employment
- 91 - infrastructure is permanent responsibility of govt, shouldn't only work
    on it during slumps; this isn't what job guarantee is for
- 104 - "The program is productive *because* it eliminates the negative return
    from joblessness, and *because* it stabilizes the economy better than
    unemployment."
- 105 - "When the emphasis is on the project, rather than on the person, it
    invariably becomes difficult to advocate for jobs for all. That becomes
    possible when the emphasis is on the scourge of unemployment and the need to
    guarantee the basic economic right to a job." <- initially didn't find this
    satisfying, but it's very honest. figuring out how I feel about it. it's an
    admission that some of this will be make-work
- 105 - critique that employers would have to meet / exceed job guarantee
    standards: "This critique is a thinly veiled argument in support of firms'
    privilege to pay poverty wages."
- 106 - euthanizing poverty jobs is feature, not bug - protest will come from
    firms, not workers

## 6: the job guarantee, the green new deal, and beyond
- 122 - green new deal pays dues to workers in mining and oil
- 123 - not hard to make them whole: only ~500k workers in mining, oil, gas

## things to look up
- 25 - sam fleming fed has no reliable theory of inflation
- 70 - beardsley ruml 1946 article taxes for revenue are obsolete
