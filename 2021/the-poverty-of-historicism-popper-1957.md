## preface
- vii - apparently popper made a proof that you can't predict the future that looks quite similar to halting problem to me
- viii - title is an allusion to marx's the poverty of philosophy which is in turn alluding to proudhon's philosophy of poverty

## i: the anti-naturalistic doctrines of historicism
- 11 - every event in social life can be said to be new; might be classified with other events, but it's unique
- 16 - social scientists unlike physical scientists in that their pronouncements actually influence future developments. social scientist may try to find truth, but statements do exert influence, destroying objectivity
- 29 - methodoligical nominalists ask questions like "how does this piece of matter behave", think science is only describing how things behave and that this can be done "by freeling introducing new terms whenever necessary, or by re-defining old terms wherever convenient while cheerfully neglecting their original meaning. For they regard _words_ merely as _useful instruments of description_."
- 29 - essentialists ask questions like "what is force?" or "what is justice" - concerned with essences
- 29 - philosophers sometimes ask biologists to define life or evolution and sometimes they'll answer, but most of their work is descriptive
- 30 - social scientists more often do essentialism instead of nominalism

## ii: the pro-naturalistic doctrines of historicism
- 48 - "Any social science which does not teach the impossibility of rational social construction is entirely blind to the most important facts of social life, and must overlook the only social laws of real validity and importance."
- 51 - historicists believe future is on fixed trajectory, so "Activism can be justified only so long as it acquiesces in impending changes and helps them along."; believe "society will necessarily change but along a predetermined path that cannot change"
- 52 - historicist might say that nobody can change social development, only able to interpret it

## iii: criticism of the anti-naturalistic doctrines
- 56 - kant: "it is _wisdom_ that has the merit of selecting, from among the innumerable problems which present themselves, those whose solution is important to mankind"
- 56 - hayek: "economic analysis has never been the product of detached intellectual curiosity about the _why_ of social phenomena, but of an intense urge to reconstruct a world which gives rise to profound dissatisfaction."
- 57 - absurdly topical section about areas of interest in social sciences, a bit about centralized planning is compatible with democratic control, and also "the question of how to export democracy to the Middle East."
- 65 - "The piecemeal technologist or engineer recognizes that _only a minority of social institutions are consciously designed while the vast majority have just 'grown', as the undesigned results of human actions_."
- 66 - can't design a foolproof organization; "institutions, at best, can reduce the uncertainty of the personal element"; "Institutions are like fortresses. They must be well designed _and_ properly manned."
- 67 - piecemeal engineer knows how little he knows; will avoid doing changes w/ complexity + scope that makes it hard to figure out cause / effect, know what he's really doing
- 69 - piecemeal eng can tackle problem w/ open mind, holist can't: already decided to change the whole system; prejudices utopianist against limits to state control
- 74 - historicists and utopianists both interested in "whole" of society, but science isn't done on wholes like this
- 81 - mistake to believe that history exists in holistic sense bc we can only deal with select specifics; written history is narrow slice of 'total' development, and is v incomplete for even that slice
- 85 - utopian 'experiments' aren't done to gain knowledge, they're done assuming the right change is known; only experiments in that their outcomes are uncertain
- 88 - "not only trial but error is necessary. And he must learn not only to expect mistakes, but conciously search for them. We all have an unscientific weakness for being always in the right"
- 88 - scientific methods in politics means "greater art of accepting the responsibility for [our mistakes], of trying to learn from them, and of applying this knowledge so that we may avoid them in the future."
- 88 - "it is very hard to learn from very big mistakes"
- 89 - utopian will have to ignore complaints to get anything done bc some people complain about anything, but in so doing, likely that reasonable criticism is suppressed
- 90 - utopian "Unable to ascertain what is in the minds of so many individuals, he must try to simplify his problems by eliminating individual differences: he must try to control and steriotype interests and beliefs by education and propoganda" - these efforts make it impossible to know what people really think
- 95 - if we know anything about differences in attitudes in history, it's from experiments in our own minds
- 103 - despite impossibility of knowing universal validity of physical laws, we don't usually qualify

## iv: criticism of the pro-naturalistic doctrines
- 108 - really seems like this argument would be a lot easier with some chaos theory / complexity theory. too bad this was written in 1957
- 121 - science "cannot start with observations, or wich the 'collection of data', as some students of the method believe. Before we can collect data, our interest in _data of a certain kind_ must be aroused: the _problem_ always comes first."
- 122 - "I suggest that to give a causal explanation of a certain _specific event_ means deducing a statement describing this event from two kinds of premises: from some _universal laws_, and from some singular or specific statements which we may call the _specific initial conditions_." - so close to chaos here. extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and blammo you got it. oh well!
- 124 - "use of a theory for _predicting_ some specific event is just another aspect of its use for _explaining_ such an event." - big disagree. predicting is a lot easier than explaining bc you can have a bunch of correlations that _are_ useful for prediction but not actually useful for establishing cause. maybe i'm missing the point here, i guess he does say this is using a theory, so i guess it could be valid. idk predicting != explaining for me tho
- 128 - "that trends occur cannot be doubted" - they're just coupled with specific conditions
- 130 - historicists "cannot imagine a change in the conditions of change
- 134 - "if we are uncritical we shall always find what we want: we shall look for, and find, confirmations, and we shall look away from, and not see, whatever might be dangerous to our pet theories"
- 134 - "I do not believe that we ever make inductive generalizations in the sense that we start with observations and try to derive our theories from them." - we start with hypothesis / motivation that guides observations that "helps us to select from the innumerable objects of observations those which may be of interest"
- 135 - "it is irrelevant from the point of view of science whether we have obtained out theories by jumping to unwarranted conclusions or merely by stumbling over them" - how did you find your theory is a private matter, how did you test it is the science
- 141 - you can assume total rationality + knowledge in theory and then measure deviation in real observations
- 142 - psych doesn't need to be treated as base of all social science, just another one
- 143 - econ is not physics bc not reducible to few constants - variables constantly changing: implies reduced significance, interpretability, testability
- 143 - "history is characterized by its interest in actual, singular, or specific events, rather than in laws or generalizations"
- 144 - only in history that we are interested in cause of single historical event - idk what about engineers figuring out why bridge fell?
- 148 - some sound elements to historicism: valid critique of view of history as great tyrants and great generals
- 150 - no history without point of view; "history must be _selective_ unless it is to be choked by a flood of poor and unrelated material"
- 150 - shoud "consciously introduce a _preconceived selective point of view_ into one's history; that is, to write "that history which interests us_." - don't twist facts to fit point of view, but don't worry about stuff that is irrelevant to point of view
- 151 - point of view cannot be tested, just a way to get good ideas. call this a historical interpretation
- 151 - mistake to take fertility of point of view as confirmation that it's correct
- 152 - historians who oppose historicism fall into other error: "Aiming at objectivity, they feel bound to avoid any selective point of view; but since this is impossible, they usually adopt points of view without being aware of them. This must defeat their efforts to be objective, for one cannot possibly be critical of one's own point of view, and conscious of its limitations, without being aware of it."
- 152 - "The way out of this dilemma, of course, is to be clear about the necessity of adopting a point of view; to state this point of view plainly, and always to remain conscious that it is one among many, and that even if it should amount to a theory, it may not be testable."
- 158 - psych can't be basis of social science bc 'human nature' varies with institutions, so psych presupposes understanding of institutions
- 159 - "If the growth of reason is to continue, and human rationality to survive, then the diversity of individuals and their opinions, aims, and purposes must never be interfered with (except in extreme cases where political freedom is endangered). Even the emotionally satisfying appeal for a _common purpose_, however excellent, is an appeal to abandon all rival moral opinions and the cross-criticisms and arguments to which they give rise. It is an appeal to abandon rational thought."
- 159 - "Holistic control, which must lead to the equalization not of human rights but of human minds, would mean the end of progress."

## conclusion
- 161 - almost looks like historicists compensating for loss of unchanging world by clinging to unchanging law governing its change

## things to look up
- 54 - the open society and its enemies
- 55 - polanyi economica
- 105 - hayek on scientism
- 142 - p sargant florence 1933 the logic of industrial organizations
