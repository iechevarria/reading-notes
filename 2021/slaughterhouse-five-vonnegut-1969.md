- 11 - "The nicest veterans in Schenectady, I thought, the kindest and funniest ones, the ones who hated the war the most, were the ones who'd really fought."
- 62 - "Billy turned on the Magic Fingers, and he was jiggled as he wept."
- 70 - "When food came in, the human beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful. They shared."
- 73 - "There was a soft drink bottle on the windowsill. Its label boasted that it contained no nourishment whatsoever."
- 75 - love the description of the bomber war movie playing in reverse. very funny
- 88 - "each clump of symbols is a brief, urgent message â€“ describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once, not one after the other. There isn't any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of a life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time."
- 95 - "They were so elated by their own hospitality"
- general - love the repetition
- general - love the super omniscient narrator
