these are just some funny quotes from the stranger.

## Part One: 1
- 3 - "I even said, "It's not my fault." He didn't say anything. Then I thought I shouldn't have said that"
- 16 - The man from the undertaker's said something to me then which I missed. He was lifting the edge of his cap with his right hand and wiping his head with a handkerchief with his left at the same time. I said, "What?" He pointed up at the sky and repeated, "Pretty hot." I said, "Yes."


## Part One: 2
- 19 - "But, in the first place, it isn't my fault if they buried Maman yesterday instead of today, and seconds, I would have had Saturday and Sunday off anyway. Obviously, that still doesn't keep me from understanding my boss's point of view."
- 20 - "I told her Maman had died. She wanted to know how long ago, so I said, "Yesterday." She gave a little start but didn't say anything. I felt like telling her it wasn't my fault, but I stopped myself because I remembered I'd alread ysaid that to my boss. It didn't mean anything. Besides, you always feel a little guilty."


## Part One: 5
- 41 - "That evening Marie came by to see me and asked me if I wanted to marry her. I said it didn't make any difference to me and that we could if she wanted to. Then she wanted to know if I loved her. I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't anything but that I probably didn't love her. "So why marry me , then?" she said. I explained to her that it didn't really matter and that if she wanted to, we could get married. Besides, she was the one who was doing the asking and I was saying yes. Then she pointed out that marriage was a serious thing. I said, "No." She stopped talking for a minute and looked at me without saying anything. Then she spoke. She just wanted to know if I would have accepted the same proposal from another woman, with whom I was involved in the same way. I said, "Sure." Then she said she wondered if she loved me, and there was no way I could know about that. After another moment's silence, she mumbled that I was peculiar, that that was probably why she loved me but that one day I might hate her for the same reason. I didn't say anything, because I didn't have anything to add, so she took my arm with a smile and said she wanted to marry me. I said we could do it whenever she wanted."

## Part Two: 2
- 79 - "And the more I thought about it, the more I dug out of my memory things I had overlooked or forgotten. I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored. In a way, it was an advantage."
- 80 - "I hadn't understoof how days could be both long and short at the same time: long to live through, maybe, but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another. They lost their names. Only the words "yesterday" and "tomorrow" still had any meaning for me."

## Part Two: 5
- 108 - "Then I blame myself every time for not having paid enough attention to accounts of executions. A man should always take an interest in those things. You never know what might happen. I'd read storeies in the papers like everybody else. But there must have been books devoted to the subject that I'd never been curious enough to look into. Maybe I would have found some accounts of escapes in them."
- 109 - "The fact that the sentence had been read at eight o'clock at night and not at five o'clock, the fact that it could have been an entirely different one, the fact that it had been decided by men who change their underwear, the fact that it had been handed down in the name of some vauge notion called the French (or German, or Chinese) people - all of it seemed to detract from the seriousness of the decision."
- 122 - "I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world"
