## preface
- ix - "I suspect that he enjoyed some mystery and notoriety for obscurantism"
- general - just a lovely description of who minsky was as a person

## introduction
- 3 - stability changes behavior, policy, business so that instability results
- 7 - andrew mellon, treasury secretary said liquidate everything during great depression - selloff caused price collapse
- 15 - stable economy makes profit hard to find bc opportunity becomes saturated

## 1. overview of minsky's main contributions
- 21 - minsky 1988: "to be useful, analytical tools have to be embedded in an understanding of the instutions, traditions, and legalities of the market."
- 23 - "He would often sit in the middle of the audience and read a newspaper while others lectured - appearing to ignore them - but then launch penetrating questions in the discussion that followed."
- 25 - minsky: "If I had my way the standard American course in economics would be introduced in the context of social sciences and history. The current American way of teaching economics leads to American economists who are well-trained but poorly educated."
- 28 - banking is holding making customer payments and holding their IOUs
- 29 - reserve requirements easy to circumvent by borrowing reserves just in time, so banks create money, and if central bank wants to influence lending, need to affect bank decision to lend, customer decision to borrow; can use underwriting reqs or interest rate changes
- 30 - minsky wanted banks off the open market and at fed discount window so they would have to open their books, lead to closer supervision + safer banking
- 33 - finance accelerates boom and also bust bc forced selloffs by debtors
- 34 - minsky was against war on poverty bc made people dependent on welfare - advocated for employer of last resort instead
- 42 - 90s consumber debt bad bc demand lost both cash spending and borrowed spending -> worse downturn
- 42 - didnt want coprorate income tax or payroll tax bc feared that payroll tax incentivized capital over labor
- 43 - didnt want automatic cost of living adjustments in transfer payments so that inflation wouldnt automatically go up
- 44 - ELR would reduce inflation by increasing supply more than increasing demand
- 44 - modern stock market primarily for speculation, not capital investment -> high employment stabilizing bc induces consumption-led growth vs investment-led
- 45 - wanted small-medium decentralized banks so none were too big to fail
- 46 - wanted smaller firms bc small firms use more labor-intensive manufacturing than large ones
- 46 - liked industrial policy because it creates a capable labor force; also prefered industrial policy bc antitrust didnt cause small firms to flourish

## 2. where did we go wrong? macroeconomics and the road not taken
- 52 - real business cycle: people unemployed because they choose to be because they become less productive and the wage they would have to take is lower than they want to. so unemployment is really voluntary vacation bc people don't want a drop in wages
- 53 - on neoclassical economics: they're dumb and "Those who developed these theories actually got Nobels for this work."
- 56 - general theory summarized: "Entrepenuers produce what they expect to sell, and there is no reason to presume that the sum of these production decisions is consistent with the full employment level of output either in the short run or in the long run."
- 57 - downward wage flexibility would be bad: income effect more than offsets substitution effect; lower wages drop profits -> drop demand for labor
- 60 - "In conclusion, most economists "didn't see it coming" because their approach to economics denies that "it" could happen
- 62 - full employment through private investment causes inequality
- 66 - distribution matters more than overall level of wealth when economy is going well
- 67 - minsky: "The acceptability and value of a money depends upon the existence of payments denominated in that money: thus fiat money without a government that taxes and spends and credit money without debtors under constraint to meet payments commitments are quite meaningless concepts."
- 68 - govt budgeting to prevent waste, graft, not to balance

## 3. minsky's early contributions: the financial instability hypothesis
- 75 - minsky: "The only universal rule for Federal Reserve policy is that it cannot be dictated by any universal rule."
- 76 - easier to put floor under speculation (bailouts) than to cap speculation with ceiling -> habituates actors to recklessness -> minsky said regulatory rules had to change often in response to private innovation (gotta change the meta lol)
- 78 - demand prices for capital assets partially determined by amount of borrowing needed -> exposers buy/borrower to more bankruptcy risk, so willing to pay less
- 78 - supply / demand prices determined independently of one another, demand about expectations, supply about current output price
- 78 - optimism increases demand price, lowers supply price b/c lower borrower / lender risk
- 79 - optimism: lots of capital assets b/c high demand price low supply price; pessimism reversed
- 80 - attempts to leverage into speculation can be frustrated: speculative position could remain hedge position if incomes higher than anticipated; investment boom could raise demand + spending, so generate more sales than projected -> consistently beat borrowing firms' expectations, so get increasingly crazy bets -> speculative boom (sounds awfully similar to recent tech dynamics)
- 80 - "Thus, in an investment boom, profits would be increasing along with investment, helping to validate expectations and encouraging even more investment." - extremely procyclical
- 81 - private sector expansion causes tax revenue to grow faster than income, so private sector balance sheet degrades -> govt-led expansion more sustainable b/c govt deficit safer than private deficit
- 82 - circular reasoning in capitalist economy: sufficient investment now only if expectations of sufficient investment in the future
- 85 - globalization increased uncertainties
- 86 - wage stickiness does not cause unemployment -> opposite point that keynes was making, he thought wage stickiness important for stability

## 4. minsky's views on money and banking
- 87 - minsky 1975: "A bank is not a money lender that first acquires and then places funds....a bank first lends or invests and then "finds" the cash to cover whatever cash drains arise."
- 89 - "we'll look at Minsky's alternative view. It has the advantage of being correct!"
- 92 - money always created out of thin error - aside from cash, only exists as entries on balance sheet
- 95 - banks special because deposit insurance, have sovereign backing - not about money creation bc anyone can make money
- 100 - balance sheets w/ assets w/ longer maturity than liabilities need refinancing, so dependent on orderly market
- 103 - bank buys IOU of firm by issuing deposit IOU, finances position by issuing own deposit IOU
- 104 - banks settle with each other, so any bank's IOUs will do as payment
- 105 - commercial banking insufficient for massive capital investments at end of 19th century, so investment banking showed up
- 108 - "Fed control over banks is all about "price" (the cost of fed funds), not quantity, of reserves."

## 5. minsky's approach to poverty and unemployment
- 109 - minsky 1971: "The liberal's War on Poverty was born out of neo-classical theory in which it is the poor - not the economy - that is to blame for poverty. The War on Poverty tried to change the poor, not the economy."
- 114 - economic growth increases inequality mildly, trickling down doesn't happen on its own
- 114 - poverty improvements more about social security expansion, not war on poverty programs
- 115 - jobs first, then provide training on the job - don't just do training
- 118 - "technological and other structural changes to job markets would outstrip any ability to educate and retrain displaced workers for the types of jobs that would exist"
- 118 - "In a dynamic society that is always riasing the skills goalposts, that long gestation period almost guarantees that many individuals achieving the age of labor force entry will not be prepared for the jobs that then exist... For that reason, jobs would need to be created to resolve the mismatch."
- 121 - problems with high private investment for growth:
  - 1. tax incentives increase inequality
  - 2. high capital incomes lead to opulent consumption by rich, emulation by poor, possibly causing demand-pull inflation
  - 3. govt spending for high-skilled labor, increasing inequality in workforce
  - 4. targeting size of capital income increases business confidence -> more leverage -> instability
- 122 - tools to move to full employment not the same ones that sustain it
- 126 - ELR increase in employment greater than it would first appear b/c people would start working who weren't counted as unemployed 
- 128 - price / profit constraints needed at full employment to prevent inflation
- 128 - inflation less concern now bc enormous deflationary pressure from globalization
- 129 - minsky wanted out of gold standard bc it prevented full employment
- 134 - ELR details: dismissed 3 times in 12-month period = 12 month non-participation. allowed to unionize

## 6. minsky and the global financial crisis
- 137 - securitization in part a response to monetarism, opened opportunity for nonbank financing
- 142 - goldman sachs went from partnership to publicly held with hired management -> lol skin in the game -> institutions run in interests of management, not owners; executive comp paid for short-term performance (echoes piketty)
- 143 - shadow banks ate into banking earnings, so banks needed to get around bank regulations to keep pace
- 145 - minsky worried keynesian policies would generate inflation by putting money into most advanced sectors, would increase inequality among workers bc benefits to sectors / workers with power already
- 149 - cash-out equity finance used in clinton years b/c govt surplus
- 150 - growth pushed by bubbles pushed by private debt -> debt got too big, consumers stopped borrowing -> collapse
- 152 - mortgage market tanked -> MMMFs worried about commercial paper from banks bc banks held MBSs -> run on commercial paper, other liabilities -> banks had trouble refinancing positions but also couldn't sell MBSs bc nobody else could finance purchases
- 154 - author says it wasn't just a liquidity crisis but also solvency crisis, says lender of last resort recipients were likely insolvent
- 156 - lender of last resort from fed also came at low rate, allowing profit + restoring health
- 158 - minsky would have extended lender of last resort to nonbanks + would have been cool with liquidity support
- 159 - fed did auctioning of limited funds, minsky would have said lend infinitely at the discount window to look at their books. fed feared that markets wouldnt like banks going to discount window bc signal that they were in trouble, make it harder to raise in private markets
- 160 - banks nationalized after great depression, worked well, minsky would have liked that instead of wholesale bailout we got

## 7. minsky and financial reform
- 167 - net cash flow more important than net worth in bank - lot of assets can't be liquidated in crisis
- 168 - bank faces tighter liquidity + solvency constraints than a normal bank
- 173 - underwriting was bad in US housing bubble
- 173 - if banks and thrifts do better underwriting than US govt, let them do it
- 173 - fixed-rate mortgages very hard to value
- 175 - some moral hazard in lending: may lend w/ unfavorable terms + creates products that pay off if defaults -> incentive to push for default
- 175 - long-term debt riskier than short term bc both default risk and interest rate risk
- 176 - partnership banks more risk-averse because partner money at risk; hired management paid in stock options -> incentive to pump share value
- 176 - minsky thought glass-steagall was already outdated by early 90s -> "He believed that these changes are in large part market-driven and not solely caused by deregulation."
- 177 - minsky thought small-medium banks do better underwriting b/c relationship oriented
- 177 - economies of scale for banking achieved at relatively small banks
- 178 - wanted to advantage smaller banks by allowing them to bundle more activities
- 178 - Minsky: "in such packaged financing the selection and supervisory functions of lenders and underwriters are not as well done as they might be when the fortunes of the originators are at hazard over the longer term." -> better explanation of skin in the game than taleb; good underwriting promoted when underwriter exposed to long term risks; securitization basically eliminated underwriting
- 182 - too big to fail unfair to smaller institutions
- 183 - "If banks are not doing good underwriting, it is difficult to see why government needs them as partners: it would be much simpler to have government directly finance activities it perceives to be in the public interest ... In other words, the government could just directly make the loans, rather than backstopping private banks that make them."
- 184 - federal govt can collect debt by way of IRS
- 185 - reserve ratios worse than just controlling credit by restricting loan volume, types of lending, higher down payments, better collateral
- 186 - "Nor should governmet policy try to get banks to make loans they do not want to make! After all, if banks are our underwriters, and if their assessment is that there are no good loans to be made, then we should trust their judgment."
- 187 - forcing banks to borrow directly from the fed gives fed more leverage over banks, wouldnt necessarily refuse to lend, but could see the banks' books
- 189 - minsky: "In the position-making view, bank failures do not arise simply because of incompetence or corrupt management. THey occur mainly because of the interdependence of payment commitments and position-making transactions across institutions and units."
- 190 - regulation needs to adapt, needs to be made consistent with evolving structures - inherited regulations may be useless

## 8. conclusion: reforms to promote stability, democracy, security, and equality
- 195 - "Policy formation must be dynamic, always evolving to adapt to behavioral adaptations that the policy induces."
- 196 - securitization reflects two developments: search for return by glut of managed money, decline of importance of banks in favor of markets
- 197 - banks need larger spread to stay operational than shadow banks bc they have more operational costs
- 198 - shadow bank innovation forced regulations to be relaxed on banks
- 201 - "There is no real-world smooth relationship between higher rates and reduction of loan demand. When rates get sufficiently high to induce insolvency, defaults finally snowball through the economy, causing panic and collapse of spending."
- 202 - rate hikes not appropriate for controlling bank lending -> down payment / collateral reqs, cease and desist orders to prevent financing some activities
- 207 - minsky to eliminate corporate income tax, but impute earnings to owners -> reduce incentive to retain earnings, reduce use of stock options, reduce bias toward debt
- 208 - commercial paper market pressured bank margins -> moved from relationship banking w/ underwriting to originate-to-distribute
- 209 - minsky wanted to favor banks over non-banks
- 209 - narrow banking loses sight of the fact that banks for for capital development of economy
- 210 - deposit insurance needed bc nobody can inspect a bank to see if it's good - some might say use ratings agency, but they suck too: see GFC
- 215 - minsky wanted regulation based on function, not institution type so shadow banks wouldnt be able to race to the bottom
- 216 - 40% of profit goes to finance, so much attention paid to developing finance
- 219 - minsky 1996: "Capitalism can be successful only if economists and polcymakers recognize that peopel have a limited tolerance for uncertainty and insecurity."
- 220 - minsky was a man of culture: loved to crap on sterile american malls

## endnotes
- 226 - "He found that he could explain much more complicated ideas using English rather than math ... Like Keynes, Minsky gave up math (both took college degrees in math) so that he would be free to explore more complicated ideas."
- 234 - "in Keynes's theory, greater flexibility of wages would likely cause unemployment to rise! For Keynes, relative stability of wages actually improves stability of markets."
