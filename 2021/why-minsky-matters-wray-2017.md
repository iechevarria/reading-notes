## preface
- ix - "I suspect that he enjoyed some mystery and notoriety for obscurantism"
- general - just a lovely description of who minsky was as a person

## introduction
- 3 - stability changes behavior, policy, business so that instability results
- 7 - andrew mellon, treasury secretary said liquidate everything during great depression - selloff caused price collapse
- 15 - stable economy makes profit hard to find bc opportunity becomes saturated

## 1. overview of minsky's main contributions
- 21 - minsky 1988: "to be useful, analytical tools have to be embedded in an understanding of the instutions, traditions, and legalities of the market."
- 23 - "He would often sit in the middle of the audience and read a newspaper while others lectured - appearing to ignore them - but then launch penetrating questions in the discussion that followed."
- 25 - minsky: "If I had my way the standard American course in economics would be introduced in the context of social sciences and history. The current American way of teaching economics leads to American economists who are well-trained but poorly educated."
- 28 - banking is holding making customer payments and holding their IOUs
- 29 - reserve requirements easy to circumvent by borrowing reserves just in time, so banks create money, and if central bank wants to influence lending, need to affect bank decision to lend, customer decision to borrow; can use underwriting reqs or interest rate changes
- 30 - minsky wanted banks off the open market and at fed discount window so they would have to open their books, lead to closer supervision + safer banking
- 33 - finance accelerates boom and also bust bc forced selloffs by debtors
- 34 - minsky was against war on poverty bc made people dependent on welfare - advocated for employer of last resort instead
- 42 - 90s consumber debt bad bc demand lost both cash spending and borrowed spending -> worse downturn
- 42 - didnt want coprorate income tax or payroll tax bc feared that payroll tax incentivized capital over labor
- 43 - didnt want automatic cost of living adjustments in transfer payments so that inflation wouldnt automatically go up
- 44 - ELR would reduce inflation by increasing supply more than increasing demand
- 44 - modern stock market primarily for speculation, not capital investment -> high employment stabilizing bc induces consumption-led growth vs investment-led
- 45 - wanted small-medium decentralized banks so none were too big to fail
- 46 - wanted smaller firms bc small firms use more labor-intensive manufacturing than large ones
- 46 - liked industrial policy because it creates a capable labor force; also prefered industrial policy bc antitrust didnt cause small firms to flourish

## 2. where did we go wrong? macroeconomics and the road not taken
- 52 - real business cycle: people unemployed because they choose to be because they become less productive and the wage they would have to take is lower than they want to. so unemployment is really voluntary vacation bc people don't want a drop in wages
- 53 - on neoclassical economics: they're dumb and "Those who developed these theories actually got Nobels for this work."
- 56 - general theory summarized: "Entrepenuers produce what they expect to sell, and there is no reason to presume that the sum of these production decisions is consistent with the full employment level of output either in the short run or in the long run."
- 57 - downward wage flexibility would be bad: income effect more than offsets substitution effect; lower wages drop profits -> drop demand for labor
- 60 - "In conclusion, most economists "didn't see it coming" because their approach to economics denies that "it" could happen
- 62 - full employment through private investment causes inequality
- 66 - distribution matters more than overall level of wealth when economy is going well
- 67 - minsky: "The acceptability and value of a money depends upon the existence of payments denominated in that money: thus fiat money without a government that taxes and spends and credit money without debtors under constraint to meet payments commitments are quite meaningless concepts."
- 68 - govt budgeting to prevent waste, graft, not to balance

## 3. minsky's early contributions: the financial instability hypothesis
- 75 - minsky: "The only universal rule for Federal Reserve policy is that it cannot be dictated by any universal rule."
- 76 - easier to put floor under speculation (bailouts) than to cap speculation with ceiling -> habituates actors to recklessness -> minsky said regulatory rules had to change often in response to private innovation (gotta change the meta lol)
