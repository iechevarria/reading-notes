## 1: the challenge of the future
- 6 - future is going to be different + rooted in today's world
- 10 - "a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future"

## 2: party like it's 1999
- 12 - "If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth." - sound a lot like byrne hobart's reasoning from first principles post
- 21 - contrarian principles:
    1. it is better to risk boldness than triviality
    2. a bad plan is better than no plan
    3. competitive markets destroy profits
    4. sales matters just as much as product
- 21 - market high in march 2000 was peak insanity but also peak of clarity. people looked far into future and saw themselves capable of creating it
- 22 - ask how much of business is shapen by "mistaken reactions to past mistakes"

## 3: all happy companies are different
- 25 - "if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business." - so many people call themselves 'content creators' - seems like willingly making self into commodity. bad!
- 29 - don't get focus on trivial differentiators, focus on competitive reality
- 31 - google's don't be evil is "characteristic of a kind of business that's successful enough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence."
- 33 - monopolies keep innovating bc profits enable them to make long-term plans + finance ambitious projects - is this really true? much innovation in small companies, less in big

## 4: the ideology of competition
- 35 - very girard, very good! 
- 35 - "More than anything else, competition is an ideology–*the* ideology–that pervades our society and distorts out thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it–even though the more we compete, the less we gain."
- 39 - "Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past."

## 5: last mover advantage
- 50 - "Network effects can be powerful, but you'll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small."
- 54 - amazon started with books deliberately even though founding vision was to win all of retail
- 56 - "Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually. The most successful companies make the core progression–to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets–a part of their founding narrative."
- 56 - if firm founded in opposition to existing firms, can't be completely new, won't be a monopoly
- 57 - "don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible"

## 6: you are not a lottery ticket
- 61 - when people lack plans, they use rules to make portfolio of options, see extracurriculars in school (sounds like index mindset)
- 62 - definite person chooses one thing to do and focuses on it insted of "many-sided mediocrity"
- 68 - baby boom produced indefinite optimists bc things got better for every year of their early lives and it didn't have anything to do with them
- 69 - malcolm gladwell says bill gates just got lucky – "Gladwell at first appears to be making a contrarian critique of the self-made businessman, but actually his own account encapsulates the conventional view of a generation."
- 71 - "Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself" - keynes agrees! money exists bc uncertainty
- 77 - indefinite optimism unsustainable - how can future be better if nobody plans for it?
- 78 - leanness is methodology, not goal - small changes to what exists gets you to local, not global optimum
- 80 - "A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random."

## 7: follow the money
- 91 - matters what you do, need to focus on what you're good at + what is valuable in future
- 91 - differences between companies dwarf differences in roles inside companies

## 9: foundations
- 112 - smaller board = better
- 112 - every member of board matters
- 112 - 3 person board ideal. never should exceed 5 unless publicly held
- 113 - everyone should be involved full time except maybe lawyers / accountants so that incentives aligned
- 114 - ceo shouldn't make more than $150k salary
- 114 - if ceo doesnt set example by having lowest salary, can have highest salary to set ceiling on cash comp
- 115 - equity distribution will never be totally fair. keep the details secret

## 10: the mechanics of mafia
- 122 - get new hires by focusing on mission and team
- 123 - job assignments not just about works and tasks but relationships between employees. at paypal made everyone responsible for doing just one thing, so couldnt compare with each other -> reduced conflict. "Eliminating competition makes it easier for everyone to build the kinds of long-term realtionships that transcend mere professionalism."

## 11: if you build it, will they come?
- 130 - superior sales / distribution can create monopoly without product differentation. converse not true
- 132 - complex sales work best without salesmen. alex karp, ceo at palantir, spends 25 days a month selling on the road. buyers want to talk to ceo, not vp of sales at $1-100m
- 132 - good enterprise sales strategy starts small and builds over time. need a pool of reference customers
- 134 - smb don't use tools enterprise take for granted bc distribution to these businesses is difficult, hidden bottleneck

## 13: seeing green
- 166 - best projects likely to be overlooked, best problems ones nobody else tries to solve
- 171 - best way to do green tech is start small, maybe remote islands or modular reactors for military installations. challenge is to think small

## 14: the founder's paradox
- 188 - companies that create new technology resemble feudal monarchies. singular foundar can make decisions, inspire loyalty, plan for decades. bureacracy can last longer than lifetime but act on shorter time horizons
- 189 - we need individual founders, don't need to worship ayn randian prime movers. "Rand was a merely half-great writer: her villains were real, but her heroes were fake... To believe yourself invested with divine self-sufficiency is not the mark of a strong individual, but of a person who has mistaken the crowd's worship–or jeering–for the truth."

## conclusion: stagnation or singularity?
- "We cannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to work to create it today."

## general notes
- thiel really does come off like a marxist, cites marx, into materialism (bits and atoms vs things). or at least a leftie. very easy to go in the opposite direction with this foundation. importance of less profit pressure for innovation leads me to think state-supported r&d at bell labs
- really like emphasis on importance of selling
