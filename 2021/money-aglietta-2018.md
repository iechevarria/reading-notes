the following are my notes on money by aglietta. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that caught my eye.

## introduction
- 3 - real estate assets single largest element of private wealth, acquisition requires taking on debt; derived from ground rent; has no equilibrium price, no fundamental value; competition to get real estate only increases rent, sole limit is buyers' monetary capacity; financial dynamics of RE are moved by logic of momentum, spiraling interaction of rising credit and prices, not equilibrium price
- 4 - economics project for 3 centuries -> "This project consists in the total separation of economics from the rest of society"
- 5 - money needs to be excluded to "establish the ideology of a 'pure' economy separate from the political sphere"
- 6 - "Money is not an immutable object. It is an institutional system that develops across history."

## part i: money as a relation of social belonging
- 12 - money is a social bond that makes links -> "But such links can be drawn only by rejecting economic science's pretention to be an autonomous discipline"
- 14 - "the influence exerted by beliefs corresponds to a counterfactual future time."
- 14 - idea that agents know 'true model' of economy "can only appear as absurd.Such a hypothesis also does enormous harm to economics' supposed scientific character"

## 1: money is the foundation of value
- 19 - when management sees labor as cost only -> "The resulting governance practices are likely to undermine workers' motivation and, eventually, the conception of labour as a dis-utility will prove self-fulfilling, to the detriment of the economy as a whole."
- 23 - financial market given role of prophet -> "it takes individual beliefs and transforms them into a common belief that market participants hold to be external to themselves, even though they have themselves produced it."
- 28 - lol "The economist who threw himself into these acrobatics was Don Patinkin."
- 30 - "_logically speaking, money precedes market relations_; and _money is a more fundamental social bond than the market_."
- 31 - "Since every exchange has, as its counterpart, a movement of money, and since money is unanimously accepted, the economy can be simultaneously both decentralised and integrated."
- 32 - value does not pre-exist exchange -> "Exchange for money – that is, payment – is what produces value."
- 32 - tautology: "Since money is the means of access to exchange, when it is unanimously accepted, no one has an interest in rejecting it." pretty useless sentence
- 33 - exchanges in market economy are above all accounting relations
- 35 - "Counter to the substantialist theory of utility-scarcity, the relational theory of value stipulates that value only makes sense in relation to other people."
- 36 - people's desires aren't predetermined facts, results of social interactions
- 36 - "Desires for objects are strategies for social recognition. They can only be defined by the other people involved in this same quest."
- 36 - "This mimetic model's strength is that it reveals the emergence, from amid this general confusion, of a polarisation around one single object of desire recognized by all"
- 45 - "Money does not buy goods because it has a value equivalent to their own. Rather it confers on goods a value that did not previously exist"
- 45 - exchange not validated by each transaction -> "Rather, it is validated in the settling of transaction balances, which implicates the whole payments matrix"
- 46 - bilateral exchange alone doesn't create value; only happens under auspices of society via finality of paymets
- 47 - in pure metallic money system, balances are settled automatically
- 48 - "a money is a money only within a given monetary space"
- 48 - must exist ultimate source of liquidity on whose books bankd debts are settled; this is a central bank
- 49 - "the central bank extracts information about tensions emerging in bank liquidity, and thus about imbalances affecting the monetary economy as a whole" -> not as much as minsky would hope!
- 52 - "whoever holds liquidity can obtain means of payment without submitting themselves to the market"
- 53 - "To hold liquidity is thus to have the capacity for absolute autonomy from the market. This is why liqduidity inspires unlimited desire, unbound by any conception of utility – for liquidity is power of over the whole of the society that epxresses a desire for money."
- 54 - confidence reduces uncertainty; if you think you know what someone else can do, your economic environment gets less complex
- 55 - austrians really against neutrality of money (guess they're not all bad)
