the following are my notes on money by aglietta. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that caught my eye.

## introduction
- 3 - real estate assets single largest element of private wealth, acquisition requires taking on debt; derived from ground rent; has no equilibrium price, no fundamental value; competition to get real estate only increases rent, sole limit is buyers' monetary capacity; financial dynamics of RE are moved by logic of momentum, spiraling interaction of rising credit and prices, not equilibrium price
- 4 - economics project for 3 centuries -> "This project consists in the total separation of economics from the rest of society"
- 5 - money needs to be excluded to "establish the ideology of a 'pure' economy separate from the political sphere"
- 6 - "Money is not an immutable object. It is an institutional system that develops across history."

## part i: money as a relation of social belonging
- 12 - money is a social bond that makes links -> "But such links can be drawn only by rejecting economic science's pretention to be an autonomous discipline"
- 14 - "the influence exerted by beliefs corresponds to a counterfactual future time."
- 14 - idea that agents know 'true model' of economy "can only appear as absurd.Such a hypothesis also does enormous harm to economics' supposed scientific character"

## 1: money is the foundation of value
- 19 - when management sees labor as cost only -> "The resulting governance practices are likely to undermine workers' motivation and, eventually, the conception of labour as a dis-utility will prove self-fulfilling, to the detriment of the economy as a whole."
- 23 - financial market given role of prophet -> "it takes individual beliefs and transforms them into a common belief that market participants hold to be external to themselves, even though they have themselves produced it."
- 28 - lol "The economist who threw himself into these acrobatics was Don Patinkin."
- 30 - "_logically speaking, money precedes market relations_; and _money is a more fundamental social bond than the market_."
- 31 - "Since every exchange has, as its counterpart, a movement of money, and since money is unanimously accepted, the economy can be simultaneously both decentralised and integrated."
- 32 - value does not pre-exist exchange -> "Exchange for money – that is, payment – is what produces value."
- 32 - tautology: "Since money is the means of access to exchange, when it is unanimously accepted, no one has an interest in rejecting it." pretty useless sentence
- 33 - exchanges in market economy are above all accounting relations
- 35 - "Counter to the substantialist theory of utility-scarcity, the relational theory of value stipulates that value only makes sense in relation to other people."
- 36 - people's desires aren't predetermined facts, results of social interactions
- 36 - "Desires for objects are strategies for social recognition. They can only be defined by the other people involved in this same quest."
- 36 - "This mimetic model's strength is that it reveals the emergence, from amid this general confusion, of a polarisation around one single object of desire recognized by all"
- 45 - "Money does not buy goods because it has a value equivalent to their own. Rather it confers on goods a value that did not previously exist"
- 45 - exchange not validated by each transaction -> "Rather, it is validated in the settling of transaction balances, which implicates the whole payments matrix"
- 46 - bilateral exchange alone doesn't create value; only happens under auspices of society via finality of paymets
- 47 - in pure metallic money system, balances are settled automatically
- 48 - "a money is a money only within a given monetary space"
- 48 - must exist ultimate source of liquidity on whose books bankd debts are settled; this is a central bank
- 49 - "the central bank extracts information about tensions emerging in bank liquidity, and thus about imbalances affecting the monetary economy as a whole" -> not as much as minsky would hope!
- 52 - "whoever holds liquidity can obtain means of payment without submitting themselves to the market"
- 53 - "To hold liquidity is thus to have the capacity for absolute autonomy from the market. This is why liqduidity inspires unlimited desire, unbound by any conception of utility – for liquidity is power of over the whole of the society that epxresses a desire for money."
- 54 - confidence reduces uncertainty; if you think you know what someone else can do, your economic environment gets less complex
- 55 - austrians really against neutrality of money (guess they're not all bad)

## 2: logics of debt and forms of sovereignty
- 59 - uh oh starts talking about life debt. pretty sure graeber specifically said that was dumb lol
- 61 - money not a creature of the state but has close relation to it
- 61 - "As we accumulate absolute liquidity, we symbolically experience the feeling of possessing a fraction of the collective."
- 63 - money unanimously accepted -> "Money is just accepted ... because it is accepted!"
- 65 - in capitalism "individuals are bearers of social rights and thus creditors to the state."
- 70 - liberal doxa of maximum competition presents self as objective "which concels the authority that enunciates this rule. The objectivation of the rul puts it out of reach, creating the perception that it is a natural reality."
- 70 - liberation of the individual threated by uncertainty over future -> "This enslaves the subject to a self-referential logic, by way of the frenzied search for liquidity."

## part ii: the historical trajectories of money

## 3: from ancient empires to the gold standard
- 86 - egypt had high labor price: 1 day of textile making slave labor = 1/4 cow
- 87 - mesopotamia used silver as primary money, copper second, gold only for official exchange between empires
- 88 - chinese money from first appearance was fiduciary money, not tied to weight of value of coins themselves, hence first country able to issue notes
- 93 - "monetary disorder always and everywhere equates to social and political disorder."
- 99 - lack of money can cause crisis bc prevents debts from being paid
- 101 - catilinarian conspiracy caused insurrection w/ unification between rural + urban pleb debtors + young elite debtors
- 102 - "it was hoarding that caused payment crises. It was the frenzied quest for liquidity that destroyed liquidity." -> worse when money supply more rigid
- 102 - caesar handled debt crisis well -> evaluated assets at pre-crisis (pre-war) values + abolished parts of debts + banned hoarding cash + minted extra money
- 104 - stability in prices between 215 and 274 despite big adjustments in coin values
- 107 - church used local monies -> created exchange markets
- 118 - banks get confidence from repeated successful transactions -> methodical confidence
- 125 - "One of history's tricks is the fact that measures taken to resolve some urgent problem can produce the turning points that alter the course of history, and consequences that no contemporaneous government had even imagined."
- 127 - "This procedure is the majoritarian rule that does not in itself prevent the dictatorship of the majority over the minority. This procedural logic undermines the unifying principle that is inherent to self-transcendence." this sucks man, bad writing lol
- 139 - free banking can work within financial communities, not for vast heterogeneous monetary spaces
- 140 - free banking: banks can issue notes + deposits w/o restriction, but had to convertible; vulnerable in periods of stress when banks low on metal reserves -> cause bank runs
- 140 - free banking only viable if it creates clearing houses that can be "a lender of last resort during liquidity crises. To this end, the clearing house must regulate the banks that are members of the system. So, Free Banking is viable only if it transforms into its opposite: into a system organised hierarchically around a superior bank capable of injecting a means of interbank payments that is acceptable in all circumstances." -> echoes of konings + spontaneous centralization
- 142 - "In times of crisis, and particularly when convertibility was suspended, the clearing houses in the United States acted as central banks: transferring their certificates was equivalent to settlement among their members." - higher quality of settlement money -> hierarchical authority for clearing houses
- 142 - members of clearing system must collectively cover liquidity risk whenever any of them cannot settle its EOD position -> clearing houses had strict regulatory powers: capital reqs, reserve ratios, etc.
- 143 - private clearing hosues preserved only members' internal payments -> "Excluding the other banks, they aggracted the crisis for the peripheral banks whose debt positions had to be settled in cash."
