the following are my notes on money by aglietta. this is not a summary. instead, these are ideas that caught my eye.

## introduction
- 3 - real estate assets single largest element of private wealth, acquisition requires taking on debt; derived from ground rent; has no equilibrium price, no fundamental value; competition to get real estate only increases rent, sole limit is buyers' monetary capacity; financial dynamics of RE are moved by logic of momentum, spiraling interaction of rising credit and prices, not equilibrium price
- 4 - economics project for 3 centuries -> "This project consists in the total separation of economics from the rest of society"
- 5 - money needs to be excluded to "establish the ideology of a 'pure' economy separate from the political sphere"
- 6 - "Money is not an immutable object. It is an institutional system that develops across history."

## part i: money as a relation of social belonging
- 12 - money is a social bond that makes links -> "But such links can be drawn only by rejecting economic science's pretention to be an autonomous discipline"
- 14 - "the influence exerted by beliefs corresponds to a counterfactual future time."
- 14 - idea that agents know 'true model' of economy "can only appear as absurd.Such a hypothesis also does enormous harm to economics' supposed scientific character"

## 1: money is the foundation of value
- 19 - when management sees labor as cost only -> "The resulting governance practices are likely to undermine workers' motivation and, eventually, the conception of labour as a dis-utility will prove self-fulfilling, to the detriment of the economy as a whole."
- 23 - financial market given role of prophet -> "it takes individual beliefs and transforms them into a common belief that market participants hold to be external to themselves, even though they have themselves produced it."
- 28 - lol "The economist who threw himself into these acrobatics was Don Patinkin."
- 30 - "_logically speaking, money precedes market relations_; and _money is a more fundamental social bond than the market_."
- 31 - "Since every exchange has, as its counterpart, a movement of money, and since money is unanimously accepted, the economy can be simultaneously both decentralised and integrated."
- 32 - value does not pre-exist exchange -> "Exchange for money – that is, payment – is what produces value."
- 32 - tautology: "Since money is the means of access to exchange, when it is unanimously accepted, no one has an interest in rejecting it." pretty useless sentence
- 33 - exchanges in market economy are above all accounting relations
- 35 - "Counter to the substantialist theory of utility-scarcity, the relational theory of value stipulates that value only makes sense in relation to other people."
- 36 - people's desires aren't predetermined facts, results of social interactions
- 36 - "Desires for objects are strategies for social recognition. They can only be defined by the other people involved in this same quest."
- 36 - "This mimetic model's strength is that it reveals the emergence, from amid this general confusion, of a polarisation around one single object of desire recognized by all"
- 45 - "Money does not buy goods because it has a value equivalent to their own. Rather it confers on goods a value that did not previously exist"
- 45 - exchange not validated by each transaction -> "Rather, it is validated in the settling of transaction balances, which implicates the whole payments matrix"
- 46 - bilateral exchange alone doesn't create value; only happens under auspices of society via finality of paymets
- 47 - in pure metallic money system, balances are settled automatically
- 48 - "a money is a money only within a given monetary space"
- 48 - must exist ultimate source of liquidity on whose books bankd debts are settled; this is a central bank
- 49 - "the central bank extracts information about tensions emerging in bank liquidity, and thus about imbalances affecting the monetary economy as a whole" -> not as much as minsky would hope!
- 52 - "whoever holds liquidity can obtain means of payment without submitting themselves to the market"
- 53 - "To hold liquidity is thus to have the capacity for absolute autonomy from the market. This is why liqduidity inspires unlimited desire, unbound by any conception of utility – for liquidity is power of over the whole of the society that epxresses a desire for money."
- 54 - confidence reduces uncertainty; if you think you know what someone else can do, your economic environment gets less complex
- 55 - austrians really against neutrality of money (guess they're not all bad)

## 2: logics of debt and forms of sovereignty
- 59 - uh oh starts talking about life debt. pretty sure graeber specifically said that was dumb lol
- 61 - money not a creature of the state but has close relation to it
- 61 - "As we accumulate absolute liquidity, we symbolically experience the feeling of possessing a fraction of the collective."
- 63 - money unanimously accepted -> "Money is just accepted ... because it is accepted!"
- 65 - in capitalism "individuals are bearers of social rights and thus creditors to the state."
- 70 - liberal doxa of maximum competition presents self as objective "which concels the authority that enunciates this rule. The objectivation of the rul puts it out of reach, creating the perception that it is a natural reality."
- 70 - liberation of the individual threated by uncertainty over future -> "This enslaves the subject to a self-referential logic, by way of the frenzied search for liquidity."

## part ii: the historical trajectories of money

## 3: from ancient empires to the gold standard
- 86 - egypt had high labor price: 1 day of textile making slave labor = 1/4 cow
- 87 - mesopotamia used silver as primary money, copper second, gold only for official exchange between empires
- 88 - chinese money from first appearance was fiduciary money, not tied to weight of value of coins themselves, hence first country able to issue notes
- 93 - "monetary disorder always and everywhere equates to social and political disorder."
- 99 - lack of money can cause crisis bc prevents debts from being paid
- 101 - catilinarian conspiracy caused insurrection w/ unification between rural + urban pleb debtors + young elite debtors
- 102 - "it was hoarding that caused payment crises. It was the frenzied quest for liquidity that destroyed liquidity." -> worse when money supply more rigid
- 102 - caesar handled debt crisis well -> evaluated assets at pre-crisis (pre-war) values + abolished parts of debts + banned hoarding cash + minted extra money
- 104 - stability in prices between 215 and 274 despite big adjustments in coin values
- 107 - church used local monies -> created exchange markets
- 118 - banks get confidence from repeated successful transactions -> methodical confidence
- 125 - "One of history's tricks is the fact that measures taken to resolve some urgent problem can produce the turning points that alter the course of history, and consequences that no contemporaneous government had even imagined."
- 127 - "This procedure is the majoritarian rule that does not in itself prevent the dictatorship of the majority over the minority. This procedural logic undermines the unifying principle that is inherent to self-transcendence." this sucks man, bad writing lol
- 139 - free banking can work within financial communities, not for vast heterogeneous monetary spaces
- 140 - free banking: banks can issue notes + deposits w/o restriction, but had to convertible; vulnerable in periods of stress when banks low on metal reserves -> cause bank runs
- 140 - free banking only viable if it creates clearing houses that can be "a lender of last resort during liquidity crises. To this end, the clearing house must regulate the banks that are members of the system. So, Free Banking is viable only if it transforms into its opposite: into a system organised hierarchically around a superior bank capable of injecting a means of interbank payments that is acceptable in all circumstances." -> echoes of konings + spontaneous centralization
- 142 - "In times of crisis, and particularly when convertibility was suspended, the clearing houses in the United States acted as central banks: transferring their certificates was equivalent to settlement among their members." - higher quality of settlement money -> hierarchical authority for clearing houses
- 142 - members of clearing system must collectively cover liquidity risk whenever any of them cannot settle its EOD position -> clearing houses had strict regulatory powers: capital reqs, reserve ratios, etc.
- 143 - private clearing hosues preserved only members' internal payments -> "Excluding the other banks, they aggracted the crisis for the peripheral banks whose debt positions had to be settled in cash."

## 4: the upheavals of the twentieth century
- 148 - resurgence of liberal ideology -> "What followed was an extraordinary ideological swindle, by way of the claim that the new era of globalised finance was in fact serving to eradicate poverty and reduce global inequality."
- 150 - should give up on 'natural' value of money, precious to locke -> "It is to assert the autonomy of the social world from ideal economic laws, which are imaginary. It is to admit that social rules – and monetary rules first among them – are entirely man-made and instituted by society without any transcendent point of reference.
- 155 - more means of private payment doesn't undermine central bank influence -> actually strengthens it b/c more complexity in payments + more volume + shorter intervals all increase systemic risk
- 155 - "If one believes certain writers who are rather too keen on science fiction, electronic money" - lol grouching about btc
- 157 - "informational asymmetries that result from the act of credit cannot be eliminated by transfer technologies." -> says internet cos don't want to get into banking bc they would be regulated as banks, i disagree, tech cos are taking that on bc banking is super sticky, so ok w/ banking regs
- 159 - not great section on cryptocurrency! written in 2016 tho
- 162 - "Only when faced with repeated and consistent indications to the contrary will agents let go of the idea that money's purchasing power remains stable."
- 167 - "economic theory that takes individuals as its foundation is indifferent to the divisions between such individuals' situations. For it automatically assumes that these divisions are based on merit, in that they result exclusively from individual choices." -> not necessarily so, but then going from the people who actually argue this way, you would think so lol
- 173 - btc detached from notion of public good; "Bitcoin maintains the illusion of a virtual community through networks of those who promote it and exchange knowledge about it. But it is not supported by any hierarchically organised..." -> so can't guarantee liquidity or respond to real economy needs
- 174 - btc by definition unequal, favors early adopters to detriment of newcomers
- 174 - "Fixed in advance, the supply of bitcoin cannot respond to the global need for liquidity."
- 180 - wants monetary recognition of the commons to overcome environmental externalities (zizek on odd lots has a decent counterpoint i think)
- 181 - better alternative to QE (which creates no new income) = buying assets that are counterparty to new real investment

## part iii: crises and monetary regulation
- 188 - in crisis, feverish search for means of protecting existing assets - ends up "polarising around some new shared belief" often external to former space, usually means foreign currency - "Hence, mimicry is the general logic in play in extreme monetary crises, at the critical moment in which the official currency is rejected."
- 189 - two types of monetary crisis, first is fragmentation -> money so scarce that debt settlement gets paralyzed -> bankruptcies + collapse in asset prices; liquidity preference aggravates crisis; this is deflationary crisis
- 189 - second type is extreme centralization -> savers feel wealth is threatened, try to get out of money -> "As they run away from money, an inflationary spiral develops that raises doubts over the long-term integrity of the unit of account."

## 5: monetary crises in history
- 193 - between 274-295 prices in egypt increased 48x - as if agents rejected unit of account and fixed prices to gold
- 194 - constantine broke inflationary spiral w/ christianity changing nature of sovereignty -> confiscated pagan temple gold -> rebuilt monetary system on basis of gold, decreed debts paid in gold -> between 346-388 20x increase in gold money circulation
- 194 - only could handle inflation after taking account of private behaviors -> "It was the change of political sovereignty that allowed an effective monetary reform, and not the other way around."
- 202 - england had coinage problems, high quality coin hoarded/exported -> "The famous private search for money, which theorists assumed would bring about a single means of payment as a point around which actors would converge, led nowhere."
- 203 - 1600s had arbitrary stuff - "clearly demonstrated that the arbitrariness of the public authorities had made it impossible to establish a national debt."
- 206 - john law had modern approach to economics - "Money creation had to be based on expected future wealth, and no longer on the past wealth accumulated in precious metals."
- 208 - john law had to leave france in december 1720 - almost exactly 300 years ago! neat!
- 208 - law's system failed bc needed 1% growth rate that no european country could sustain until industrial revolution
- 210 - 1815 england's natl debt 260% of gdp - took 40 years to get under 100% and had advantage of industrial revolution
- 216 - 1878 froze quantity of greenbacks, issuing new ones forbidden; this w/ productivity gains from industry, created long period of deflation from 1873-95
- 217 - jp morgan had to go to london to get a gold loan in 1893 to loan $65m to treasurys
- 218 - national banking act failed to defragment american banking system bc lacked federal clearing + settlement system
- 218 - in 1907 knickerbocker trust company had a bank run, but wasn't memeber of ny clearing house bc refused its conditions, so couldn't get clearing house's emergency aid -> contagion spread to all trusts + banks (sounds like shadow banking! shows you need to support shadow banks + force them to take on conditions)
- 220 - more centralized federal reserve made in 1913 basically bc the dems won in 1912 - would have been decentralized if republicans won. total accident of history wow
- 223 - contra monetarism, inflation not proprtional to rise in quantity of money -> "the 'real' mass of money – the nominal mass of money divided by the general level of prices – tends towards zero. Monetary expansion is a catalyst that can help to self the self-referential logic of indexation into motion. This catalyst is what casts doubt on the permanence of monetary rules, and thus undermines confidence in money. But once this phase of indexation is underway, it no longer depends on monetary expansion."
- 227 - german hyperinflation caused division between towns and countryside - retention of produce from market -> "The consequence was a collapse in econoic activity. _Nominal hyperinflation is also real hyperdeflation_. This totally contradicts the quantitative theory of money and the supposed neutrality of money in relation to the real economy."
- 232 - kalecki + robinson: "hyperinflation is the consequence of a violent conflict over resources, the presence of an indexation mechanism and the sudden abandonment of the national currency in favour of a substitute."
- 232 - final years of allende had cost of living increase 100x while real money stock lost 70% of value
- 234 - 1980s us monetary policy brought oil shock -> crises in all raw-materials producer countries
- 234 - brazilian real plan based on inertial consideration of inflation, understanding it was self-referential process
- 235 - real's success also bc it was consensual + participatory, consulted w/ range of actors, didn't have price freeze, confiscation of goods, savings, or break of contracts
- 236 - ecuadorian dollarization was attempt to reconquer political sovereignty that it lost internally by abandoning monetary sovereignty
- 238 - 1987 crisis banks worried about market maker fragility, wouldnt lend to them, settlement system endangered by market maker collapse -> fed did lender of last resort stuff
- 239 - "Abundant macroeconomic liquidity can thus coexist with insufficient market liquidity, on account of informational asymmetries and counterparty risks." - sounds like lily
- 242 - country on floating interest rate -> "the anticipated depreciation of the country's exchange rate will be self-fulfilling. The rise in foreign exchange rate swells indebtedness and weakens the balance-sheet structure. This increases risk premiums and thus increases the short-term cost of renewing debt. The result is a fall in capital's profitability, weakened investment and a sharp brake on growth, or even a recesion if the balance sheets worsen significantly."
- 243 - part of reason why asian + latam countries moved to become export countries + accumulated forex reserves to protect against future shocks

## 6: monetary regulation under capitalism
- 247 - "ayatollahs of market efficiency" lmao
- 248 - in monetary economy, central bank has info other agents don't bc can see extract info from central clearing process, can make informed discretionary decisions - "Of course, these effects will only faour overall economic stability if the collective rationality that the central bank promotes is continually enriched with a practical knowledge, drawn from its presence on the capital markets." - sounds like minsky!!
- 257 - minsky finally shows up lmao took too long
- 259 - been clear since 1980s that short-term variation in cash demand unpredictable - setting objective for monetary base will bring excess / insufficiency of reserves -> huge daily variations in interest rate - "So it is impossible to impose tight controls on the quantity of the monetary base, unless we accept senseless variations in short-term interest rates."
- 261 - german labor negotiation system indexed to gdp - "The fact that this common reference point is taken into account in negotiations on income sharing and setting offer prices allows for inflationary pressures to be eased, without excessive losses in production or employment."
- 263 - natural rate changes over time, competition stimulates innovation, is highly uncertain -> "This is why a non-contingent rule for fixing the policy rate, founded on an estimation of a supposedly stable neutral rate, would itself be a factor for destabilisation when economic conditions change."
- 265 - in 80s, demand for money unstable -> "Monetarism thus had to be shelved along with the other pieces of monetary policy." lol
- 269 - "Market actors are financed on credit, against a collateral which is the speculative asset itself. They, like those lending to them, have an interest in maintaining momentum, because there is no fundamental value in playing the role of an incontestable benchmark for the market."
- 270 - "An insolvency risk builds up on the balance sheets, but it remains concealed as long as the momentum continues. It resides in the invisible probability that the bubble of speculation will burst."
- 272 - "Financial actors thus have an interest in joining and remaining within the bubble that increases their capital gains due to cheap leverage. _The crisis is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict the moment when it is going to break out_."
- 274 - "Identifying vulnerabilities rather than potential shocks enables greater attention to be paid to the systemic impact of shocks if they do indeed take place." - really excellent point
- 275 - three macroprudential tools: requirements for counter-cyclical capital buffers, loan-to-value + debt-to-income ratios, required reserve ratios (minsky against this one i think)
- 279 - extreme crisis reduces incentive to invest bc capital's net meginal yield is close to zero or lower - this is what secular stagnation looks like
- 281 - if central bank forward guidance is credible, then anticipation-element of long-term rates stays low + reduces influence that volatility of future short term rates has on price of risk -> pushes down rate curve as a whole
- 282 - rise in price of risk reflects weakened liquidity of investors
- 282 - central bank purchases state debt to control term premium
- 282 - central bank hopes to incentivize long-term investors to reduce risk aversion, invest in a way that brings out real investment (this is portfolio channel)

## part iv: the enigma of international currency
- 286 - payment system works best when payments settled and final - need a highest form of liquidity to do this
- 286 - "In this era, international relations have been affected by something of an Unidentified Flying Object in the monetary landscape: namely, the euro." lol
- 287 - "International liquidity is a public good that has never found its necessary institutional solution."

## 7: international currency faced with the test of history
- 290 - currency used in exchange will tend to be used as unit of account + reserve of value -> tend to converge towards one dominant currency
- 292 - if financial integration complete, must be only one top form of liquidity
- 292 - "if two currencies are competing to be the basis for ultimate liquidity in the world economy, then their exchange rate is indeterminate."
- 294 - "the more two currencies can be substituted for one another, the more unstable their exchange rate becomes" - small differences trigger movements between them, true bc demand for money isn't demand for a good, but "It is collective because an individual's demand for the services of the payment system is an increasing function of others' demand."
- 298 - in second globalization, "capital movements have essentially been a matter of speculation, driven by a mode of competition based on mimicry."
- 301 - 1889-1913 had strongly cyclical prices + incomes, much more variable than 1960-1997
- 304 - uk was pivot of gold standard system, had least gold reserves
- 304 - end of gold standard started in may 1873 bc vienna had real estate speculation
- 305 - uk was on its way out, only at the top bc us's weak financial system which was fixed w/ fed in 1913
- 309 - 1928 financial crisis started w/ florida real estate boom
- 309 - 1929 crash mostly stayed in markets, only in autumn 1930 did banking crisis hit (sounds like 07-08!!)
- 309 - by march 1933, real debt burden increased 40% bc deflation
- 316 - keynes: capital controls need to be permanent, floating exchange rates not capable of good equilibrium of balance of payments
- 318 - us hypothetically had to keep gold $35/ounce, but not in reality bc govts in us orbit never demanded gold conversion
- 318 - "The US's monetary policy was not subject to any form of constraint from a global feedback mechanism able to regulate worldwide liquidity. This is the dollar's exorbitant privilege." ->  exchange focus on dollar + fixed gold price in dollars + empty gold-convertability constraint -> "monetary expansion in the rest of the world subject to monetary expansion in the United States."
- 319 - intl monetary system needs to solve 2 problems:
    1. provide global supply of liquidity necessary for exchange
    2. ensure balances of payments are adjusted to balance out supply + demand of currencies
- 320 - bretton woods existed in full force from 1958-1971 bc it failed to deal with either problem
- 320 - when us rate went below european rate, dollars flooded europe -> dollars placed on us money market, increased money supply in rest of world by increasing foreign central banks' reserves -> invest reserves in us financial system made dollars available to us residents again, us money supply immunised from liquidity outflow in dollars -> basically pure dollar standard system, global money supply determined by us as long as exchange rates fixed
- 321 - "Since the creation of money depended exclusively on the US's domestic policy objectives, the supply of international liquidity was not adjusted to demand."
- 327 - international monetary system officially governed by pure dollar system in 1971, released from any consideration of international coherence -> nixon forced fed chair to run inflationary policy by threatening fed independence
- 333 - financial cycle not correlated to short-term macro cycle - financial cycle greater in periodicity + extent
- 333 - not all business cycles can be understood in terms of financial cycle, only most severe crises combined w/ reversal in financial cycle
- 334 - "We should not underestimate the real estate market's role in the _momentum_ dynamic that drives the financial cycle. Momentum means that the trajectory of prices over time is the consequence of self-reinforcing interactions between market participants' anticipations and their attitudes towards risk." - debt + asset prices interact 
- 335 - international capital movements has not been positive for long-term growth
- 335 - "If a closed economy is the starting point, the opening up of finance does benefit growth up to a certain point. But once that threshold has been passed, it becomes harmful."
- 338 - ultimate liquidity collective good, results from polarization of demand for protection against uncertainty of crisis; "It cannot be the property of more than one currency at the same time." - dollar persistent bc no currency can replace it (hm dunno about this argument ok tho)
- 339 - dollar inertia bc high cost of switching currencies, especially true w/ oil mkt
- 339 - goldberg + tille: involuntary coalition effect between firms in same industry to use same unit of account to limit fluctuations in price relative to competitors -> "This logic emerges from the mimetic character of competing exporters' behavior."
- 339 - dollar also dominant bc us big enough to create enough liquidity, won't get destabilized by international use
- 340 - us also has deep + liquid financial mkts
- 343 - us privilege to import products + assets w/o giving anything in exchange 
- 344 - peripheral countries are business-cycle takers, so incentivized to have surplus foreign currency + implement "restrictive neo-mercantalist policies" w/ export-led growth

## 8: transitioning to a new international monetary system
- 350 - keynes + aglietta: intl money should be purely a vehicle
- 354 - mundell: choose no more than two of:
    1. fixed exchanges
    2. independent monetary policies
    3. perfect capital mobility
