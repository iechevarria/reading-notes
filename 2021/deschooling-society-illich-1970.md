## 1. why we must disestablish school
- 3 - poor people always lacked social power, institutional care makes them unable to fend for themselves -> loss of personal potency
- 5 - additional school funds cater to richer students
- 6 - approvingly cites friedman lol
- 8 - education + medical spending up, results no better
- 11 - we should prevent discrimination based on education credential
- 11 - bundling learning with credential is harmful, this is what school does + why it's bad; credential only measures amount of time in school, not learning
- 12 - school system was supposed to equalize chances, instead monopolized distribution
- 14 - drill training useful and effective, largely only rich people who take part
- 14 - proposes an education credit card for use for any education
- 15 - 1956 anecdote of archdiocese training high school dropouts to be spanish instructors
- 16 - doesn't like vouchers b/c they need to be used on school + plays into hands of divisive groups
- 17 - "In most schools a program which is meant to improve one skill is chained always to another irrelevant task."
- 17 - doesn't want obligatory attendance
- 19 - "The most radical alternative to school would be a network or service which gave each man the same opportunity to share his current concern with others motivated by the same concern." - goes on to describe system where people interested in the same thing put names into a computer and meet up with each other
- 20 - wants discussion to be around a specific work, not general themes b/c requires someone to make hierarchy of themes / makes bad discussions
- 21 - people don't want this b/c presumption of ignorance - "educators want to avoid the ignorant meeting the ignorant"
- 21 - worst case in his eyes: "The risk that the self-chosen discussion with one or several strangers might lead to a loss of time, disappointment, or even unpleasantness is certainly smaller than the same risk taken by a college applicant." - not really the worst case tho, real worst case is 'hey have you ever heard of race theory?' and then getting into it
- 22 - "modern man must learn how to find meaning in many structures to which he is only marginally related"
- 24 - existence of school divides society in to two realms, so "education becomes unworldly and the world becomes noneducational"

## 2. phenomenology of school
- 28 - disestablishment of school means no more discrimination against adults who want to learn
- 29 - poor are inundated w/ belief that school grants salvation
- 32 - transgression under teacher is multiple offense: broke a rule + behaved immorally + let self down

## 3. ritualization of progress
- 35 - college grad sets consumption expectations for everyone else
- 37 - universities still useful bc they are sites of social criticism - "It provides time, mobility, access to peers and information, and a certain impunity" - but only for those in university - reminds me of how to do nothing
- 39 - "Once a man or woman has accepted the need for school, he or she is easy prey for other institutions."
- 40 - "The institutionalized values school instills are quantified ones." - everything has a number ... 
- 40 - "To them, what cannot be measured becomes secondary, threatening." - sounds like legibility from seeing like a state
- 41 - curriculum development looks like any other consumer product
- 44 - "School serves as an effective creator and sustainer of social myth because its structure as a ritual game of graded promotions. Introduction into this gambling ritual is much more important than what or how something is taught. It is the game itself that schools, that gets into the blood and becomes a habit."
- 46 - school produces demand for products of capital-intensive industry
- 50 - "Pedagogical therapists will drug their pupils more in order to teach them better, and students will drug themselves more to gain relief from the pressures of teachers and the race for certificates."

##  4. institutional spectrum
- 52 - futurists say we can provide for all but political reality means they will reamin "privilege of a few"
- 55 - "The different cost of acquiring clients is just one of the characteristics which distinguish convivial from manipulative institutions." - sounds like money stuff from this morning
- 55 - manipulative institutions are addictive - "prescribe increased treatment if smaller quantities have not yielded the desired results"
- 56 - self-activated institutions tend to be self-limiting
- 57 - consumer goods push more to manipulative, produce demand
- 58 - highway system not open to just anyone - need a car. mainly accessory for private car. car makers make cars and demand for cars and demand for car infrastructure - "to sell the basic product is to "hook" society on the entire package."
- 63 - "Unemployment is the sad idleness of a man who, contrary to Aristotle, believes that [working] is virtuous and that idleness is bad. Unemployment is the experience of the man who has succumbed to the Protestant ethic."
- 63 - can fill time by juicing demand + production; alternative way is to use more durable goods + increase human interaction - kind of naive take in my view bc so much of the world production is for actually consumable stuff - durable engine still needs gas, homes dont last forever, food! water! maintenance which we're really behind on now - plenty to do

## 5. irrational consistencies
- 66 - ed tech types make dumb promises to fix education like military tech types promise to end war
- 70 - "The blind sport of educational research reflects the cultural bias of a society in which technological growth has been confused with technocratic control."

## 6. learning webs
- 75 - wonders if great cultural revolution was first success in deschooling society - it wasnt lol
- 80 - school bad because it relegates things to specific uses - the classics are part of sophomore year, microscope is for a lab - "School removes things from everyday use by labeling them educational tools."
- 81 - in school "games are not only removed from the sphere of leisure; they often become tools used to translate playfulness into competition, a lack of abstract reasoning into a sign of inferiority."
- 86 - should open up workplaces to educational tours, lot of the world's know-how locked up (budweiser of all places does this lol)
- 96 - "Instead of placing trust in professionals, it should be possible, at any time, for any potential client to consult with other experienced clients of a professional about their satisfaction with him by means of another peer network easily set up by computer" - wonder what he would think of ratemyprofessors lol - mostly a tool for engaging even further with school to see who grades easily
- 101 - aristotle + aquinas say teaching an a act of love - "This kind of teaching is always a luxury for the teacher and a form a leisure (in Greek *"schole"*) for him and his pupil: an activity meaningful for both, having no ulterior purpose."
- 104 - "The creature whom schools need as a client has neither the autonomy nor the motivation to grow on his own."

## 7. rebirth of the epimethean man
- 108 - city child takes for granted process, goals "will be defined in such a way that its achievement can be engineered"
- 109 - "A world of ever-rising demands is not just evil - it can be spoken of only as Hell."
- 110 - "We know which switch must stay open to avoid an atomic holocaust. No switch detains an ecological Armageddon."
- 114 - "The value of institutionalized man depends on his capacity as incinerator ... Man now defines himself as the furnace which burns up the values produced by his tools. And there is not limit to his capacity."
- 116 - "And if a man lived in obscurity \n making his friends in that obscurity, \n obscurity is not uninteresting"
