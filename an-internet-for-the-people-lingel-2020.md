## introduction: the politics and promise of craigslist
- 7 - "publics" term for people who gather online, less baggage than community, less sterile than network

## 1. becoming craig's list: san francisco roots and web 1.0 ethics
- 20 - california ideology:
  1) tech good for freedom / democracy
  2) tech rather than legislation / policy is solution to social problems
  3) tech companies claim to be disruptive, in reality embedded in neoliberalism
- 21 - draws libetarian view of econ, vaguely spiritual self-empowerment, combination "made only possible through a nearly universal belief in technological determinism" (barbook + cameron 1996)
- 21 - bay area tech industry bc william shockley moved lab to mountain view to live near his mother in palo alto
- 22 - recession saw workers from financial industry move into tech, change profit-oriented culture with them (don't know if 2008 really changed bc the people moved around, really might be that it became so lucrative and the money changed the culture and the motivations became more external)
- 24 - craig newmark in first interview: "I  have no social awareness of norms. I regard this as dysfunctional."
- 26 - newmark: "In 2000, people helped me understand that I wasn't the best manager, and that's when I turned things over to Jim. I then went over to Customer Service and began to help out there."
- 26 - as of 2019, newmark still does customer service work at reduced scale
- 27 - "At present, he devotes most of his time to various philanthropic causes - in particular, supporting families of veterans, voting rights, freedom of the press, and bird sanctuaries."
- 30 - murphy: "Craig was really big on craigslist not looking commercial, on it not looking slick. [He'd say,] "I just want it to be a list""

## 2. the death and life of classified ads: a media history of craigslist
- 40 - p2p exchange, gig economy, online dating all have precursors in print media
- 40 - "classifieds require sustained attention and local knowledge to be read and understood."
- 43 - classifieds allow people to address anonymous mass in prive matters
- 48 - newmark suggested competition in classifieds led print-media resentment of craigslist, hit pieces
- 49 - "while craigslist is often described as a free-for-all of idiosyncrasies, quirkiness, risk, and desire, these characteristics have a legacy in the print classified ad, which underscores the tendency of media technologies to reproduce rather than replace their predecessors."

## 3. from sex workers to data hacks: craigslist's courtroom battles
- 59 - aol sold users' personal info to direct marketers without notifying them in 1994

## 4. craigslist, the secondary market, and politics of value
- 71 - some view secondary markets as place to build social ties in neighborhood
- 72 - participant: "I realized that I could go to thrift stores and junk shops and find random things that people would pay my rent for buying, because it was valuable and sitting there gathering dust. If we have to live in a capitalist soceity, we might as well turn garbage into rent." -> lmao extremely freudian vibes from me just bc 'rent' has a specific definition in econ
- 73 - s.r. ranganathan 1931: first law of library science is that books are for use
- 77 - "Participants also described being reluctant to hand off or sell their used goods to people who, in their judgment, wouldn't contribute to a colorful provenance of a given item."
- 79 - "As much as pricing could be rational or analytical, participants also talked about moments when emotional attachment outranked monetary value."
- 80 - participant: "Oh, there is that flexible figurine from a video game from my youth that I'm never going to find anywhere else, and it's $40, which is outrageous, but I want it," - this is not the exception in capitalism!! this is the norm for how people buy things!! most consumer transactions are not about amortizing depreciation and estimating cash flows to 'rationally' choose what price to pay. it's like, huh, i want that, guess ill buy it. overly mechanical conception of economic activity masks how imbricated money is in our social fabric, ultimately naïve
- 81 - people avoid primary market - "A defiant critique of capitalist markets emerges from this perspective, which sees the mainstream market as valuing profits over people or the planet, and mainstream consumers as ignorant of the environmental and societal harms of their buying habits." - yeah but this is just the disembedding critique so it's not very good - kind of economizing, could easily be boiled into economic terms like 'big externalities and people don't realize it' which is more a critique of capitalism as practiced today vs capitalism... guess im splitting hairs but the end result could be some neoliberal shithole that has a great environment but has a permanent underclass. need to be precise in the critique otherwise you end up with weird dumb results i think
- 81 - even people who see p2p as tools for resisting capitalism, value played role in nonmonetary ways - "Used goods could become valuable through provenance, where emotional or social value accrued through previous ownership, or simply because of a highly personal interest in an artifact. Both logics of used goods defy rational norms of the primary market" -> really don't think so! provenance def matters in primary market - see 'ethical' brands or whatever. and high personal interest is what drives, like, all luxury consumption! don't think there's a way to look at this from the demand side well, unless maybe you cite cases of overpaying because you feel like someone could use the cash more than you or you want to help someone? but paying a lot because you want something *is* market logic. just bc you have an idiosyncratic valuation of provenance doesn't make it a non-market / non-capitalist transaction. a better example would be on supply side - selling something for less because the projected / expected future provenance / history of the item is more interesting. that actually gets away from market logics. and what of collectables markets? secondary but unambiguously capitalist markets. basically i think the way you prove a transaction is non-market is to consciously pay more than you otherwise would or charge less than you otherwise would. paying market price is by definition market transaction imo
- 86 - warner: "Attention is the principal sorting category by which members and nonmembers are discriminated."

## 5. craigslist gigs, class politics, and a gentrifying internet
- 92 - christina murphy one of four involved in craigslist launch; she was a headhunter, so "reflected craigslist's initial view that searching for jobs should be one of the site's key functions"
- 94 - "They typically narrated the tumult of continually finding new gigs as an acceptable trade-off for flexibility, and they tended to see themselves individually - rahter than the economy generally - as responsible for their ability to find work and make a living" -> micro advice vs macro advice again. minsky would prob be bummed at this lol. gotta dig up that 72 quote
- 96 - sometimes finding out about deals on craigslist feels more like burden, missing out can be a relief
- 96 - "A trade-off in flexibility, then, is the expanding workday, which includes the job search as well as the job."
- 99 - "workers assign themselves blame for an exploitative work arrangement" - man, big ol' reminders of konings in this whole chapter
- 100 - rather than training at company, person did themselves - "Cathy viewed her DIY training as exciting and entrpreneurial rather than a burden"
- 101 - satisfaction in turning trash into profits - boy can i relate
- 102 - "If the goal for academics is not only to reflect on the socio-technical change but to agitate for change, we have to start by recognizing the genuine appeal of the gig economy to significant parts of the labor pool." konings!
- 107 - "Because of Facebook's Ivy League roots, the platform has always had an imprint of upper-class values"
- 110 - cl is like old neighborhood bar getting gentrified as new neighbors make new aesthetic
- 112 - graham, hjorth, lehdonvirta: "If we accept that practices of work in the capitalist world system have always been characterized by exploitation and power imbalances between labor and capital, then it seems odd to think that there was even a suggestion that digital mediations of work would do anything other than amplify those processes." -> similar naïvety wrt btc
- 112 - some of discomfort in gig economy is gap between platform makers jobs and users gigs
- 112 - idea that working class should adopt middle class norms is middle class idea
- 112 - claim that cl is poor people's internet is discomfort w/ the fact that cl doesn't gatekeep

## 6. people seeking people: craigslist, online dating, and social stigma
- 124 - "Because craigslist personals were anonymous, users could also be fluid in the desires they expressed" - could try on new personas
- 126 - cl moved work of matchmaking to users, alternative to transactional tinder

## 7. craigslist's people problems: politics and failures of trust
- 147 - "In my interviews with craigslist users, white women most often associated anonymitiy with fear, frustration, and anger. In contrast, I noticed that black women's views of anonymity were more complex and revealved a greater concern for personal privacy."
- 148 - digital trust infra can enable racism / discrimination instead of building trust

## conclusion: the case for keeping the internet weird
- 154 - "While a small degree of risk is the price of entry for using craigslist, a benefit is increased privacy, which can be particularly important for people on the margins."
- 156 - solution to fraud / harassment shouldn't be outright removal of anonymity
- 156 - cl is reminder than anonymity can work, need users to handle trust more than platform
- 157 - companies can reveal data to be transparent but know published info has no use
- 157 - fb appears free bc specifically how platform makes money is opaque, cl appears free bc you dont post on the categories that require you to pay
- 158 - fb wants people as visible as possible, platform opaque
- 158 - cl wants platform to be transparent

## methods appendix
- 163 - really like this section! new for me
- 167 - user on cl for 27 years!!!
- 170 - pressure to present cl in balanced way w/o benefit of previous text to argue against / agree with (no anchor, interesting)
