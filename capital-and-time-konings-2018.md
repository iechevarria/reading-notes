# capital and time: for a new critique of neoliberal reason by martijn konings (2018)

the following are my notes on capital and time. these do not constitute a
summary. instead, these are ideas that are new to me or that caught my eye.

## introduction: beyond the critique of speculation
- 3 - today's heterodoxy is past's orthodoxy with its critique of speculation
    despite the fact there are no foundations to fall back on; not speculating
    is not an option
- 4 - critique of speculation is intellectual dead end
- 5 - claimed that speculation erodes order when instead stronger ordering
    institutions emerge that can regulate value of currency
- 8 - value of a dollar cannot be defined as anything other than a dollar,
    operates as organizing force in complex system of obligations; it's self-
    referential
- 9 - value is performative and speculative, not passive representation
- 9 - speculation can "provoke the reality" on which it speculates, can
    "induce the production of facticity" (man it'd be great to have an example,
    is this how the art market is manipulated? is it how high-water marks at
    auctions make things more valuable?)
- 10 - there exists no objective formal representation of value; impossible to
    separate material from ideal
- 11 - because it's impossible to objectively measure value, value is measured
    all the time, constant valuation
- 11 - valuation is performative, not representation, aims to generate value
    claimed to be represented (sounds like vc here)
- 14 - value is result of its context (immanent) also shapes its context
    (constitutive)
- 14 - leverage (his definition): how we make our fictitious projections real,
    how we recruit labor that makes them happen
- 16 - leverage off uncertainty, which inherently exists, by inducing others
    to invest in your promises to hedge against their uncertainty; economic
    power is not just about knowing but being known, increasing world's
    exposure to and investment in your risk (get everyone in the s&p 500)
- 17 - banks turn unknowable future in to probabilities; money is time-storage
    device allowing us to keep options open; banks exist b/c uncertainty
- 18 - banks central to life -> valuation governed by logic of bailout and
    austerity
- 20 - 20th century welfare state not balance against capitalist market but
    central to its risk logic; integration of population into capitalism; new
    deal expanded measurement of people in terms of ability to provide revenue
- 21 - american state policies entangled in banking in way it saw as bad but
    still could not do anything about it; attempts to tighten credit would
    expand shadow banking + increase instability
- 22 - neoliberalism sees speculation as productive, means engaging uncertainty
    w/ logic of governance
- 23 - neolibs: money not about barter problem, but way to construct unknown
    future; uncertainty essential to value and coordination
- 24 - neolib reason about the hope of transcending uncertainty by using
    speculation
- 25 - neolib invokes "prospect of secure life to motivate the intensified
    engagement of risk" (music's playing, gotta dance)
- 25 - it's fantasy to believe accumulation of power is unnatural, uniquely
    corrupting, but savvy neolibs align themselves w/ this view
- 26 - large segments of population integrated into capitalist logic, state
    followed
- 28 - neolib policies aimed at preemption not prevention
- 28 - selective, informal too-big-to-fail replaced inflationary across-the-
    board support
- 29 - neolibs not naive about market efficiency but savvy w/ logic of
    speculation, bailout, austerity
- 30 - "The moment of bailout is characterized by an absence of meaningful
    choice: intense uncertainty about what the future has in store comes to
    coincide with a compelling certainty as to what needs to be done." 

## chapter 1: foundationalism and self-referentiality
- 32 - ironic and sloppy that critique of economism via speculation rests upon
    idea of real value, invokes foundations of econ
- 37 - polanyian critique is that expansionary tendencies are pure negative,
    alleged to be unsustainable in long run; fails to explain why it occurs

## chapter 2: constructions and performances
- 38 - those who critique economism accept that society is constructed but do
    not accept it's constructed "all the way down"
- 42 - performativity scholarship doesn't rethink core econ, appeals to econ
    foundations for 'true value'

## chapter 3: luhmannian considerations
- 45 - luhmann: any attempt to know if things are essentially mind or matter
    is hopeless, go back and forth; cannot hope to clarify role by reducing to
    one or the other
- 47 - self-referential spectrum: recognizing dependencies -> reproducing self
- 48 - system always under pressure to choose to do something, cannot
    transcend own point of view, must speculate, make decisions without all
    knowledge (sounds like administrative behavior)
- 49 - luhmann: "Speculation takes its cue from speculation"; anticipations make
    uncertainty manageable
- 50 - actors know they have similar constraints to other actors -> something to
    strategize around; "the outcome of our investments is to a large extent
    determined by the investments they induce, and so it is often much more
    important to be known in this or that way than to expand one's knowledge.";
    control in risk society comes from being known in context of uncertainty ->
    "the purposeful creation of uncertainty and insecurity can even be a source
    of advantage" -> force people to do what you do, "endogenous
    hierarchization"; order that doesn't eliminate uncertainty, capitalizes on
    it
- 51 - "We can improve our own prospects of persistence by associating ourselves
    with a larger, more powerful entity, even if in the process we increase its
    leverage over us"
- 52 - permanent pressure to seek out alliances, integrate into higher-level
    systems

## chapter 4: system, economy, and governance
- 53 - defining money positively is impossible, it's circular
- 55 - "if we could predict the future, money would be without value; but given
    conditions of uncertainty, money holds out the promise of a secure future"
    (was thinking about this w/ historical lens - roman tributaries probably
    didn't feel this way, but perhaps the roman state did; without uncertainty,
    just requisition resources directly; again not sure if this is about
    expending the resources to predict the future vs it being totally impossible
    to do w/ any reasonable margin - just might be more efficient to use money
    so you don't have to do all that work)
- 56 - w/o foundational understanding, money reaches everything, orders
    everything
- 56 - orthodoxy: core problem is scarcity + provisioning, not about reducing
    uncertainty to quantifiable risk
- 60 - system can register irritations, doesn't have access to off-line self-
    repair function (much better / truer than previous argument)
- 60 - neolib strength: understand limit of rationalist approach, figure out how
    to steer politics which is now part of the economy (always had been tho)

## chapter 5: foucault beyond the critique of economism
- 61 - not just economy but also politics guided by order from uncertainty
- 61 - economy is central ordering mechanism of modern society
- 62 - agamben: sovereignty rooted in state's ability to make exceptions in
    crisis, order not slowly from knowledge but from logic of emergency + 
    exception
- 66 - riskless security is the impossible goal that drives this
- 67 - esposito: need to engage risk but also want immunity from risk
- 67 - "acute uncertainty tends to create its own kind of certainty - precisely
    not an ability to act on accurate knowledge of the future, but a definite
    certainty as to what needs to be done in the absence of such knowledge"
- 68 - in financial crisis, state invested in fundamentally unknown assets
    but widespread understanding it was necessary

## chapter 6: time, investment, and decision
- 73 - existence of double-entry bookkeeping only makes sense b/c we live in
    world w/o instantaneous adjustments (not neoclassical)
- 74 - only in world of uncertain investments do funds get tied up in ways that
    matter - need to generate enough revenue to keep up with debt repayment

## chapter 7: minsky beyond the critique of speculation

## critiques
- 7 - terrible sentence: "Plasticity refers to the constitutive character of
    contingent associations, the way one connection inflects the generation and
    patterning of new connections and thus adjusts the course of history,
    allowing for the emergence of determinate entities in a world that has no
    external mover."
- 14 - definitions of immanent and constitutive show up here after being used
    several times
- 39 - worst way to talk about self-fulfilling: "Here the notion of
    performativity has become closely allied with the theory of speech acts,
    which states that utterances can sometimes bring about their own truth
    conditions (as in "I hereby promise") and so highlights the constructive
    aspects of discourse and language."
- 51 - "The fact that our ability to perceive problems always exceeds the
    ability to diagnose them stems from the fact that we cannot easily
    separate ourselves from the problem" -> disagree, one question is inherently
    more difficult than the other, requires more information, more computation;
    keep coming back to analogy to airplane warning light in flight, many
    possible causes - is this the wrong way to think about it?
- 57 - history purely from european point of view, even then tenuous
- 58 - lol @ adam smith as one of the first to talk about money as barter, arab
    scholars talked about this hundred of years before, smith likely read them
- 65 - wrote in margin this was worst writing so far: "Key here is his
    differentiation of biopolitical normalization from the disciplinary norm:
    wheras the latter is associated with a transcendental understanding of
    power, the former involves a more pragmatic and relational understanding
    of normativity, seen as an endogenously generated point of reference that
    exerts organizing effects on the contingent processes from which it is born"
- 70 - again with this weird stuff about premodern time, again european only
- 71 - definition of chresmatics shows up 60 or so pages after first use

## things to look up
- 22 - foucault's lectures at the college de france (1979, 1978, 1976)
- 33 - luhmann on self-reference
